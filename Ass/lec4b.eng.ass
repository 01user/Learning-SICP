Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.29,0:05:21.76,EN,,0,0,0,,that'll bring up the issues, I think, more clearly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.87,0:05:26.01,EN,,0,0,0,,That's the problem of doing a system that does arithmetic on complex numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.77,0:05:28.92,EN,,0,0,0,,So let's take a look here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.69,0:05:31.74,EN,,0,0,0,,Just as a little review,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.04,0:05:33.53,EN,,0,0,0,,there are things called complex numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.25,0:05:38.22,EN,,0,0,0,,Complex number you can think of as a point in the plane, or z.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.37,0:05:47.19,EN,,0,0,0,,And you can represent a point either by its real-part and its imaginary-part.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.19,0:05:50.83,EN,,0,0,0,,So if this is z and its real-part is this much,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.50,0:05:53.24,EN,,0,0,0,,and its imaginary-part is that much,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.33,0:05:56.44,EN,,0,0,0,,and you write z equals x plus iy.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.11,0:06:03.21,EN,,0,0,0,,Or another way to represent a complex number is by saying,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.21,0:06:09.00,EN,,0,0,0,,what's the distance from the origin, and what's the angle?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.32,0:06:16.67,EN,,0,0,0,,So that represents a complex number as its radius times an angle.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.52,0:06:21.92,EN,,0,0,0,,This one's called -- the original one's called rectangular form,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.59,0:06:25.45,EN,,0,0,0,,rectangular representation, real- and imaginary-part
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.20,0:06:30.04,EN,,0,0,0,,or polar representation magnitude and angle--
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.04,0:06:31.48,EN,,0,0,0,,and if you know the real- and imaginary-part,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.53,0:06:33.36,EN,,0,0,0,,you can figure out the magnitude and angle.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.72,0:06:36.97,EN,,0,0,0,,If you know x and y, you can get r by this formula.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.19,0:06:39.48,EN,,0,0,0,,Square root of sum of the squares, and you can get the
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.48,0:06:40.76,EN,,0,0,0,,angle as an arctangent.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.42,0:06:44.42,EN,,0,0,0,,Or conversely, if you knew r and A you could
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.42,0:06:45.31,EN,,0,0,0,,figure out x and y.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.80,0:06:49.43,EN,,0,0,0,,x is r times the cosine of A, and y is r times the sine of A.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.34,0:06:53.66,EN,,0,0,0,,All right, so there's these two. They're complex numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.13,0:06:57.15,EN,,0,0,0,,You can think of them either in polar form or rectangular form.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.15,0:06:58.12,EN,,0,0,0,,What we would like to do
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.32,0:07:01.32,EN,,0,0,0,,is make a system that does arithmetic on complex numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.95,0:07:05.12,EN,,0,0,0,,In other words, what we'd like--
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.58,0:07:06.99,EN,,0,0,0,,just like the rational number example--
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.38,0:07:10.20,EN,,0,0,0,,is to have some operations plus c,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.73,0:07:13.90,EN,,0,0,0,,which is going to take two complex numbers and add them, subtract them,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.35,0:07:16.94,EN,,0,0,0,,and multiply them, and divide them.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.73,0:07:25.28,EN,,0,0,0,,OK, well there's little bit of mathematics behind it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.28,0:07:28.36,EN,,0,0,0,,What are the actual formulas for manipulating such things?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.41,0:07:31.92,EN,,0,0,0,,And it's sort of not important where they come from,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.00,0:07:35.79,EN,,0,0,0,,but just as an implementer let's see--
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.80,0:07:37.95,EN,,0,0,0,,if you want to add two complex numbers it's pretty easy to
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.13,0:07:42.66,EN,,0,0,0,,it's pretty easy to get its real-part and its imaginary-part.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.66,0:07:45.93,EN,,0,0,0,,The real-part of the sum of two complex numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.72,0:07:49.72,EN,,0,0,0,,real-part of the z1 plus z2
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.06,0:07:54.64,EN,,0,0,0,,is the real-part of z1 plus the real-part of z2.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.82,0:08:01.60,EN,,0,0,0,,And the imaginary-part of z1 plus z2
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.74,0:08:05.66,EN,,0,0,0,,is the imaginary part of z1 plus the imaginary part of z2.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.41,0:08:09.48,EN,,0,0,0,,So it's pretty easy to add complex numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.48,0:08:10.99,EN,,0,0,0,,You just add the corresponding parts
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.31,0:08:13.18,EN,,0,0,0,,and make a new complex number with those parts.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.37,0:08:14.73,EN,,0,0,0,,If you want to multiply them,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.53,0:08:17.82,EN,,0,0,0,,it's kind of nice to do it in polar form.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.82,0:08:20.38,EN,,0,0,0,,Because if you have two complex numbers,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.40,0:08:26.54,EN,,0,0,0,,the magnitude of their product is here, the product of the magnitudes.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.85,0:08:33.88,EN,,0,0,0,,And the angle of the product is the sum of the angles.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.80,0:08:40.54,EN,,0,0,0,,So that's sort of mathematics that allows you to do arithmetic on complex numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.54,0:08:42.38,EN,,0,0,0,,Let's actually think about the implementation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.72,0:08:47.39,EN,,0,0,0,,Well we do it just like rational numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.84,0:08:53.47,EN,,0,0,0,,We come down, we assume we have some constructors and selectors.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.76,0:08:54.52,EN,,0,0,0,,What would we like?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.33,0:08:58.16,EN,,0,0,0,,Well let's assume that we make a data object cloud,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.54,0:09:00.78,EN,,0,0,0,,which is a complex number that has some stuff in it,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.79,0:09:04.67,EN,,0,0,0,,and that we can get out from a complex number the real-part,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.52,0:09:09.64,EN,,0,0,0,,or the imaginary-part, or the magnitude, or the angle.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.15,0:09:14.01,EN,,0,0,0,,We want some ways of making complex numbers--
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.03,0:09:15.64,EN,,0,0,0,,not only selectors, but constructors.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.80,0:09:19.52,EN,,0,0,0,,So we'll assume we have a thing called make-rectangular.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.53,0:09:24.27,EN,,0,0,0,,What make-rectangular is going to do is take a real-part and
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.51,0:09:29.36,EN,,0,0,0,,an imaginary-part and construct a complex number with those parts.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.92,0:09:35.01,EN,,0,0,0,,Similarly, we can have make-polar which will taking
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.01,0:09:37.85,EN,,0,0,0,,a magnitude and an angle,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.83,0:09:43.90,EN,,0,0,0,,and construct a complex number which has that magnitude and angle.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.68,0:09:45.46,EN,,0,0,0,,So here's a system.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.46,0:09:47.77,EN,,0,0,0,,We'll have two constructors and four selectors.
