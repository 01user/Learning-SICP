Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.10,0:00:23.41,EN,,0,0,0,,PROFESSOR: Well, Hal just told us how you build robust systems.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.80,0:00:26.17,EN,,0,0,0,,The key idea was--
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.81,0:00:30.20,EN,,0,0,0,,I'm sure that many of you don't really assimilate that yet--
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.20,0:00:33.77,EN,,0,0,0,,but the key idea is that in order to make a system that's robust,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.93,0:00:36.48,EN,,0,0,0,,it has to be insensitive to small changes,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.60,0:00:37.37,EN,,0,0,0,,that is,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.37,0:00:40.90,EN,,0,0,0,,a small change in the problem should lead to only a small change in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.32,0:00:42.90,EN,,0,0,0,,There ought to be a continuity.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.90,0:00:45.94,EN,,0,0,0,,The space of solutions ought to be continuous in this space of problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.25,0:00:48.76,EN,,0,0,0,,The way he was explaining how to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.46,0:00:54.78,EN,,0,0,0,,was instead of solving a particular problem at every level of decomposition of the problem at the subproblems,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.08,0:00:56.78,EN,,0,0,0,,where you solve the class of problems,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.78,0:01:00.40,EN,,0,0,0,,which are a neighborhood of the particular problem that you're trying to solve.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.40,0:01:04.76,EN,,0,0,0,,The way you do that is by producing a language at that level of detail
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.76,0:01:10.33,EN,,0,0,0,,in which the solutions to that class of problems is representable in that language.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.37,0:01:15.09,EN,,0,0,0,,Therefore when you change makes more changes to the problem you're trying to solve,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.09,0:01:19.29,EN,,0,0,0,,you generally have to make only small local changes to the solution you've constructed,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.29,0:01:22.26,EN,,0,0,0,,because at the level of detail you're working,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.26,0:01:24.26,EN,,0,0,0,,there's a language where you can express
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.80,0:01:28.14,EN,,0,0,0,,the various solutions to alternate problems of the same type.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.04,0:01:33.74,EN,,0,0,0,,Well that's the beginning of a very important idea,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.40,0:01:38.61,EN,,0,0,0,,the most important perhaps idea that makes computer science more powerful
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.61,0:01:42.37,EN,,0,0,0,,than most of the other kinds of engineering disciplines we know about.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.38,0:01:44.73,EN,,0,0,0,,What we've seen so far
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.73,0:01:48.78,EN,,0,0,0,,is sort of how to use embedding of languages.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.26,0:01:53.36,EN,,0,0,0,,And, of course, the power of embedding languages partly comes from
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.12,0:01:56.86,EN,,0,0,0,,procedures like this one that I showed you yesterday.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.37,0:02:02.13,EN,,0,0,0,,What you see here is the derivative program that we described yesterday.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.13,0:02:05.92,EN,,0,0,0,,It's a procedure that takes a procedure as an argument
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.00,0:02:07.92,EN,,0,0,0,,and returns a procedure as a value.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.61,0:02:12.65,EN,,0,0,0,,And using such things is very nice.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.65,0:02:14.65,EN,,0,0,0,,You can make things like push combinators
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.65,0:02:16.86,EN,,0,0,0,,and all that sort of wonderful thing that you saw last time.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.68,0:02:20.54,EN,,0,0,0,,However, now I'm going to really muddy the waters.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.56,0:02:25.90,EN,,0,0,0,,See this confuses the issue of what's the procedure and what is data,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.56,0:02:27.81,EN,,0,0,0,,but not very badly.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.42,0:02:30.90,EN,,0,0,0,,What we really want to do is confuse it very badly.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.18,0:02:32.44,EN,,0,0,0,,And the best way to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.44,0:02:37.62,EN,,0,0,0,,is to get involved with the manipulation of the algebraic expressions that the procedures themselves are expressed in.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.73,0:02:45.58,EN,,0,0,0,,So at this point, I want to talk about instead of things like on this slide,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.89,0:02:49.72,EN,,0,0,0,,the derivative procedure being a thing that manipulates a procedure--
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.72,0:02:51.94,EN,,0,0,0,,this is a numerical method you see here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.94,0:02:58.93,EN,,0,0,0,,And what you're seeing is a representation of the numerical approximationto the derivative.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.29,0:03:00.44,EN,,0,0,0,,That's what's here.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.86,0:03:04.93,EN,,0,0,0,,In fact what I'd like to talk about is instead things that look like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.05,0:03:11.33,EN,,0,0,0,,And what we have here are rules from a calculus book.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.09,0:03:16.17,EN,,0,0,0,,These are rules for finding the derivatives of the expressions
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.70,0:03:20.58,EN,,0,0,0,,that one might write in some algebraic language.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.64,0:03:24.41,EN,,0,0,0,,It says things like a derivative of a constant is 0.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.13,0:03:29.09,EN,,0,0,0,,The derivative of the valuable with respect to which you are taking the derivative is 1.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.32,0:03:31.93,EN,,0,0,0,,The derivative of a constant times the function
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.09,0:03:34.37,EN,,0,0,0,,is the constant times the derivative of the function,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.77,0:03:36.04,EN,,0,0,0,,and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.05,0:03:41.38,EN,,0,0,0,,These are exact expressions. These are not numerical approximations.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.96,0:03:44.52,EN,,0,0,0,,Can we make programs?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.52,0:03:52.24,EN,,0,0,0,,And, in fact, it's very easy to make programs that manipulate these expressions.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.38,0:03:59.52,EN,,0,0,0,,Well let's see. Let's look at these rules in some detail.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.08,0:04:05.22,EN,,0,0,0,,You all have seen these rules in your elementary calculus class at one time or another.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.98,0:04:12.12,EN,,0,0,0,,And you know from calculus that it's easy to produce derivatives of arbitrary expressions.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.53,0:04:16.05,EN,,0,0,0,,You also know from your elementary calculus that it's hard to produce integrals.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.98,0:04:19.37,EN,,0,0,0,,Yet integrals and derivatives are opposites of each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.52,0:04:21.28,EN,,0,0,0,,They're inverse operations.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.61,0:04:23.30,EN,,0,0,0,,And they have the same rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.16,0:04:29.68,EN,,0,0,0,,What is special about these rules that makes it possible for one
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.68,0:04:33.65,EN,,0,0,0,,to produce derivatives easily and integrals why it's so hard?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.85,0:04:36.98,EN,,0,0,0,,Let's think about that very simply.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.40,0:04:38.38,EN,,0,0,0,,Look at these rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.36,0:04:43.06,EN,,0,0,0,,Every one of these rules, when used in the direction for taking derivatives,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.06,0:04:44.80,EN,,0,0,0,,which is in the direction of this arrow,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.68,0:04:49.16,EN,,0,0,0,,the left side is matched against your expression,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.16,0:04:53.05,EN,,0,0,0,,and the right side is the thing which is the derivative of that expression.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.02,0:04:55.65,EN,,0,0,0,,The arrow is going that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.37,0:05:00.45,EN,,0,0,0,,In each of these rules,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.24,0:05:03.72,EN,,0,0,0,,the expressions on the right-hand side of the rule
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.72,0:05:06.56,EN,,0,0,0,,that are contained within derivatives are subexpressions,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.56,0:05:10.29,EN,,0,0,0,,are proper subexpressions, of the expression on the left-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.60,0:05:13.25,EN,,0,0,0,,So here we see the derivative of the sum,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.92,0:05:16.13,EN,,0,0,0,,witch is the expression on the left-hand side
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.13,0:05:18.38,EN,,0,0,0,,is the sum of the derivatives of the pieces.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.08,0:05:24.49,EN,,0,0,0,,So the rule of moving to the right are reduction rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.02,0:05:26.61,EN,,0,0,0,,The problem becomes easier.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.56,0:05:31.48,EN,,0,0,0,,I make, I turn a big complicated problem it's lots of smaller problems
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.44,0:05:35.76,EN,,0,0,0,,and then combine the results, a perfect place for recursion to work.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.58,0:05:40.85,EN,,0,0,0,,If I'm going in the other direction like this,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.81,0:05:45.13,EN,,0,0,0,,if I'm trying to produce integrals, well there are several problems you see here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.24,0:05:49.09,EN,,0,0,0,,First of all, if I try to integrate an expression like a sum,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.21,0:05:50.81,EN,,0,0,0,,more than one rule matches.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.81,0:05:52.10,EN,,0,0,0,,Here's one that matches.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.48,0:05:53.65,EN,,0,0,0,,Here's one that matches.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.81,0:05:57.09,EN,,0,0,0,,I don't know which one to take. And they may be different.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.70,0:06:00.00,EN,,0,0,0,,I may get to explore different things.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.25,0:06:03.64,EN,,0,0,0,,Also, the expressions become larger in that direction.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.53,0:06:06.30,EN,,0,0,0,,And when the expressions become larger,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.30,0:06:10.56,EN,,0,0,0,,then there's no guarantee that any particular path I choose will terminate,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.94,0:06:13.46,EN,,0,0,0,,because we will only terminate by accidental cancellation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.24,0:06:18.05,EN,,0,0,0,,So that's why integrals are complicated searches and hard to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.12,0:06:20.96,EN,,0,0,0,,Right now I don't want to do anything as hard as that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.49,0:06:23.06,EN,,0,0,0,,Let's work on derivatives for a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.14,0:06:28.13,EN,,0,0,0,,Well, these rules are ones you know for the most part hopefully.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.78,0:06:31.88,EN,,0,0,0,,So let's see if we can write a program which is these rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.22,0:06:33.72,EN,,0,0,0,,And that should be very easy.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.89,0:06:36.21,EN,,0,0,0,,Just write the program.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.69,0:06:39.29,EN,,0,0,0,,See, because while I showed you is that it's a reduction rule,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.29,0:06:41.29,EN,,0,0,0,,it's something appropriate for a recursion.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.08,0:06:45.72,EN,,0,0,0,,And, of course, what we have for each of these rules is we have a case
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.66,0:06:47.78,EN,,0,0,0,,in some case analysis.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.58,0:06:50.36,EN,,0,0,0,,So I'm just going to write this program down.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.88,0:06:57.69,EN,,0,0,0,,Now, of course, I'm going to be saying something you have to believe. Right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.69,0:07:00.33,EN,,0,0,0,,What you have to believe is I can represent these algebraic expressions,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.68,0:07:03.88,EN,,0,0,0,,that I can grab their parts, that I can put them together.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.24,0:07:06.49,EN,,0,0,0,,We've invented list structures so that you can do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.52,0:07:09.14,EN,,0,0,0,,But you don't want to worry about that now.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.66,0:07:12.45,EN,,0,0,0,,Right now I'm going to write the program that encapsulates these rules
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.76,0:07:15.85,EN,,0,0,0,,independent of the representation of the algebraic expressions.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.42,0:07:28.84,EN,,0,0,0,,You have a derivative of an expression with respect to a variable.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.50,0:07:33.08,EN,,0,0,0,,This is a different thing than the derivative of the function.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.82,0:07:41.89,EN,,0,0,0,,It's just the answers.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.09,0:07:45.18,EN,,0,0,0,,The derivative of an expression is the way it's written.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.74,0:07:47.85,EN,,0,0,0,,And therefore it's a syntactic phenomenon.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.29,0:07:51.62,EN,,0,0,0,,And so a lot of what we're going to be doing today is worrying about syntax,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.70,0:07:55.93,EN,,0,0,0,,Well, there's a case analysis.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.50,0:08:01.08,EN,,0,0,0,,Anytime we do anything complicated thereby a recursion,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.08,0:08:02.64,EN,,0,0,0,,we presumably need a case analysis.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.16,0:08:07.40,EN,,0,0,0,,And that's usually a conditional of some large kind.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.97,0:08:12.53,EN,,0,0,0,,the first rule that you saw is this something a constant?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.50,0:08:17.50,EN,,0,0,0,,And what I'm asking is,
