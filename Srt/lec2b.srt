[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,170
PROFESSOR: Well, so far in this
course we've been talking
目前为止 我们这门课讨论的都是过程

3
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,680
about procedures, and then just
to remind you of this
而我想提醒大家的是 我们介绍的这个框架

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,090
framework that we introduced for
talking about languages,
是用来讨论语言的

5
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,980
we talked about the primitive
things that are
我们讨论内建于系统中的基本元素

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,040
built into the system.
我们讨论内建于系统中的基本元素

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,710
We mentioned some means of
combination by which you take
我们介绍了一些组合的方法

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,530
the primitive things and you
make more complicated things.
用来组合基本元素 使你能够构造更复杂的东西

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,610
And then we talked about the
means of abstraction, how you
然后我们讨论了抽象的方法

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,190
can take those complicated
things and name them so you
你如果去取用这些复杂的东西

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,770
can use them as simple
building blocks.
并且给它们命名 使得可以像简单单元那样使用它  # TBD

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,750
And then last time you saw
we went even beyond that.
我们在课程的最后甚至想要做更超前的东西

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,830
We saw that by using higher
order procedures, you can
我们看到 通过使用高阶过程

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,400
actually express general methods
for computing things.
我们甚至可以表达计算的通用方法

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,540
Like the method of doing
something by fixed points, or
这就像求不动点的方法和牛顿法

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,280
Newton's method, and so the
incredible expressive power
你可以通过组合这些抽象的方法

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,730
you can get just by combining
these means of abstraction.
来得到这种难以执行的表达力 # TBD

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,260
And the crucial idea in all of
this is the one that we build
而这些的中心观点则是

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,210
a layered system.
我们要构造一个层次系统 # TBD

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,570
So for instance, if we're
writing the square root
譬如说 如果我们编写平方根过程

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:24,950
procedure, somewhere the square
root procedure uses a
而这个平方根过程又用到了

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:33,130
procedure called good-enough,
and between those there is
一个叫good-enough的过程

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,220
some sort of abstraction
boundary.
而这两者之间就有某种抽象边界 # TBD

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,060


25
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,620
It's almost as if we go out and
in writing square root, we
这大概就像是我们开始编写平方根程序

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,940
go and make a contract with
George, and tell George that
而先要与George订好“合同”

27
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,600
his job is to write good-enough,
and so long as
告诉他 他的工作是编写good-enough过程

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,630
good-enough works, we don't
care what it does.
因此只要good-enough按我们的预期运作

29
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,380
We don't care exactly how
it's implemented.
我们就不管是如果运作的

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,360
There are levels of detail here
that are George's concern
我们不管心（它的内部）实现

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,450
and not ours.
这里的实现层面是Goerge操心的 和我们无关

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,680
So for instance, George might
use an absolute value
譬如说 George如果用了

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,370
procedure that's written by
Harry, and we don't much care
Harry写的绝对值过程 我们不会去关心这些

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,065
about that or even know that,
maybe, Harry exists.
甚至可能还不知道有Harry这个人

35
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:13,830


36
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,910
So the crucial idea is that when
we're building things, we
关键点是当我们在构造东西时

37
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,600
divorce the task of building
things from the task of
我们将构造整体的任务划分为了

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,850
implementing the parts.
实现部件的任务

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,690


40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,110
And in a large system, of
course, we have abstraction
当然 在一个大型系统中

41
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,180
barriers like this at lots, and
lots, and lots of levels.
我们有像这样的抽象屏障 在很高很高很高层次上的抽象屏障

42
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,700
And that's the idea that we've
been using so far over and
这也是我们到目前为止一直在使用的思想

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,290
over in implementing
procedures.
贯彻到每次编写过程之中

44
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,220
Well, now what we're going
to do is look at the
书归正传 我们将要

45
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,170
same issues for data.
在数据中看到同样的问题

46
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,350
We're going to see that the
system has primitive data.
我们将看到系统中有基本数据

47
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,470
In fact, we've already
seen that.
实际上我们已经看到了

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,270
We've talked about numbers
as primitive data.
我们已经看到了作为基本对象的数字

49
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,300
And then we're going to
see their means of
我们将看到适用于数据的组合方法

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,390
combination for data.
我们将看到适用于数据的组合方法

51
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,940
There's glue that allows you to
put primitive data together
有种“胶水” 让你把基本数据粘合在一起

52
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,500
to make more complicated,
kind of compound data.
来构造一种更复杂的复合数据

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,840
And then we're going to see a
methodology for abstraction
然后我们将看到一种用于抽象的方法

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,330
that's a very good thing to use
when you start building up
这种方法十分好用 尤其是

55
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,090
data in terms of simpler data.
当你开始用简易的数据构造复杂数据时

56
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,790
And again, the key idea is that
you're going to build the
再次强调 中心思想是要建立层次化的系统

57
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,700
system in layers and set up
abstraction barriers that
建立抽象屏障将细节隔离在低层

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,250
isolate the details at the lower
layers from the thing
将细节与你要做的事所在的高层隔离开  # TBD

59
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,630
that's going on at
the upper layers.

60
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,270
The details at the
lower layers, the
低层的细节

61
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,260
ideas, they won't matter.
低层的思想 都不重要

62
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,680
They're going to be George's
concern because he signed this
那是George该操心的

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,430
contract with us for how the
stuff that he implements
因为他跟我们“签了合同”

64
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,250
behaves, and how he implements
the thing is his problem.
他负责实现这些行为 怎么实现都是他的事

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,890
All right, well let's
look at an example.
好了 来看一个实例吧

66
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,990
And the example I'm going to
talk about is a system that
我们将会讨论一个系统

67
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,010
does arithmetic on
rational numbers.
一个在有理数域上做算术运算的系统

68
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,160
And what I have in mind is that
we should have something
我现在所想到的是

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,220
in the computer that allows us
to ask it, like, what's the
计算机中应该有某种东西

70
00:03:52,220 --> 00:04:00,590
sum of 1/2 and 1/4, and somehow
the system should say,
使得我们可以查询 比如说1/2加上1/4的和是多少

71
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,890
yeah, that's 3/4.
系统就会说 是3/4

72
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:11,370
Or we should be able to say
what's 3/4 times 2/3, and the
我们也可以查询3/4乘以2/3的积

73
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,650
system should be able to
say, yeah, that's 1/2.
系统因该能够回答 结果是1/2

74
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,500


75
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,730
Right?
对吧？

76
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,990
And you know what
I have in mind.
你知道我想表达的 #TBD

77
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,700
And you also know how to do this
from, I don't know, fifth
我不太确定你们是多久掌握这些运算的

78
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,410
grade or sixth grade.
五年级或者六年级吧？

79
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,510
There are these formulas that
say if I have some fraction
这有一些公式说

80
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,350
which is a numerator over a
denominator, and I want to add
一个分数是分子除以分母 # TBD

81
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,600
that to some other fraction
which is another numerator
而如果我要将这个分数与另一个分数相加的话

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,200
over another denominator, then
the answer is the numerator of
当然 这个分数也是分子除以分母 那么结果将会是

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,920
the first times the denominator
of the second,
第一个分数的分子乘以第二个分数的分母

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,885
plus the numerator of the second
times the denominator
加上第二个分数的分子乘以第一个分数的分母

85
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,930
of the first. That's the
numerator of the answer, and
当然 这只是答案的分子

86
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,260
the denominator is the product
of the two denominators.
答案的分母是两个分数的分母之积

87
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,400
Right?
对吧？

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,850
So there's something from fifth
or sixth grade fraction
这大概就是五、六年级教授的分数算术

89
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,570
arithmetic.

90
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,320
And then similarly, if I want
to multiply two things, n1
与之相似的 如果我想要将两个数乘起来

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,710
over d1 multiplied by n2 over
d2 is the product of the
n1除以d1的商 乘以 n2除以d2的商

92
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,510
numerators over the product
of the denominators.
就是两个分数的分子之积除以两个分母之积的商

93
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,330


94
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,880
So it's no problem at all, but
it's absolutely no problem to
所以这些都不构成问题

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,460
think about what computation you
want to make in adding and

96
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,760
multiplying these fractions.

97
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,010
But as soon as we go
to implement it, we
但是当我们实现这个功能的时候 我们似乎错过了什么 # TBD

98
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,920
run up across something.

99
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,320
We don't have what a
rational number is.
我们连有理数都没有

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,840
So we said that the system gives
us individual numbers,
系统只给了我们单个的数字

101
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,700
so we can have 5 and 3, but
somehow we don't have a way of
比如5和3 但我们没有去表达一个


102
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,970
saying there's a thing that has
both a 3 and a 4 in it, or
同时具有一个3和一个4的东西

103
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,850
both a 2 and a 3.
或者一个2和一个3的东西

104
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,110
It's almost as if we'd like to
imagine that somehow there are
但只要我们去想象

105
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,820
these clouds, and a cloud
somehow has both a numerator
我们就会看到一些云彩

106
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,590
and a denominator in it, and
that's what we'd like to work
某个云彩不知咋的同时具有分子和分母

107
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,840
in terms of.
这就是我们想有的语言形式 #TBD

108
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,820


109
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,320
Well, how are we going to
solve that problem?
那么 我们要怎么解决这个问题呢？

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,360
We're going to solve that
problem by using this
我们将使用一种强大的设计策略来解决这个问题

111
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,450
incredibly powerful design
strategy that you've already
这种策略我们已经反复使用过了

112
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,580
seen us use over and over.
这种策略我们已经反复使用过了

113
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,330
And that's the strategy
of wishful thinking.


114
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:25,700


115
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,870
Just like before when we didn't
have a procedure, we
就像我们之前并没有任何过程一样

116
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,420
said, well, let's imagine that
that procedure already exists.
我们就想象确实存在着过程这个东西

117
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,100
We'll say, well, let's imagine
that we have these clouds.
那么 我们就来想象我们有了（有理数）这些云彩吧

118
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,400
Now more precisely what I mean
is let's imagine that we have
更准确一点来说

119
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
three procedures, one
called make-RAT.
让我们假设我们有了三个过程 其一为MAKE-RAT

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,740


121
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,696
make-RAT is going to take as
arguments two numbers, so I'll
MAKE-RAT有两个参数

122
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:58,800
call them numerator and
denominator, and it'll return
我们分别把它们叫作分子和分母

123
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,860
for us a cloud--
它给我们返回一朵云彩——

124
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,300
one of these clouds.
我们需要的云彩

125
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,030
I don't really know
what a cloud is.
我并不知道云彩是什么

126
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,500
It's whatever make-RAT returns,
that's its business.
无论MAKE-RAT返回什么 那都是它的事

127
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,400
And then we're going to say,
suppose we've got one of these
并且我们将会说 假设我们有了一个这种云彩

128
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,800
clouds, we have a procedure
called numer, which takes in a
我们有个叫NUMBER的过程

129
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,462
cloud that has an n and a d in
it, whatever a cloud is, and I
这个过程需要我们传递有n和a的云彩

130
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,990
don't know what it is,
and returns for us
不管这个云彩是什么 我不知道这个云彩是什么

131
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,980
the numerator part.
但NUMBER过程会返回（云彩的）分子部分

132
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,750
And then we'll assume we have a
procedure denom, which again
我们也会假设我们有个叫DENOM的过程

133
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,610
takes in a cloud, whatever a
cloud is, and returns for us
该过程需要我们传递一个云彩 不管云彩是什么

134
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,850
the denominator [? required. ?] #TBD
并返回（云彩的）分母部分

135
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,530
This is just like before, when
if we're building a square
就像先前我们构造平方根过程一样

136
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,440
root, we assume that we
have good enough.
我们假设我们有GOOD-ENOUGH过程

137
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,600
Right?
对吧？

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,310
And what we'll say is, we'll go
find George, and we'll say
我们会找到George 对他说

139
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,480
to George, well, it's your
business to make us these
好吧 你的任务就是实现这三个过程

140
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,280
procedures.

141
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,170
And how you choose to implement
these clouds, that's
你选择如何实现这些云彩

142
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,060
your problem.
就是你的事了

143
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,310
We don't want to know.
我们不想知道

144
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,670


145
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,740
Well, having pushed this task
off onto George, then it's
那么 把这些杂事都推给George后

146
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,520
pretty easy to do
the other part.
完成其它部分就相当容易了

147
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,360
Once we've got the clouds, it's
pretty easy to write the
一旦我们有了这些云彩后 编写那些

148
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,820
thing that does say addition
of rational numbers.
把有理数加起来的程序就变得容易多了

149
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,820
You can just say define,
well, let's say +RAT.
你可以定义 这么说吧 定义+RAT

150
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,980


151
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,450
Define +RAT, which will
take in two rational
定义+RAT过程 该过程需要两个有理数参数 x和y

152
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,110
numbers, x and y.

153
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,880
x and y are each these clouds.
x和y就是这些云彩

154
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,539
And what does it do?
这个过程干些啥呢？

155
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,840
Well, it's going to return
for us a rational number.
它将返回给我们一个有理数

156
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,299


157
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,460
What rational number is it?
这个有理数是怎么得来的呢？

158
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,659
Well, we've got the
formulas there.
依据我们这里的公式

159
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:49,620
The numerator of it is the
sum of the product of the
结果的分子的一部分为

160
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:56,550
numerator of x and the
denominator of y.
x的分子与y的分母之积

161
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,580


162
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,950
It's one thing in the sum.
这只是结果的分子的一部分

163
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,310
And the other thing in the
numerator is the product of
结果的分子剩下的一部分是

164
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:19,060
the numerator of y and
the denominator of x.
y的分子与x的分母之积

165
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,910
The star, close the plus.
闭合* 闭合+

166
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,830
Right, that's the first argument
to make-RAT, which is
好了 这是MAKE-RAT的第一个参数

167
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,080
the numerator of the thing
I'm constructing.
这是我将要构造的云彩的分子

168
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,860
And then the rest of the thing
goes into make-RAT is the
而MAKE-RAT剩下的参数

169
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,950
denominator of the answer, which
is the product of the
则是结果的分母

170
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:42,230
denominator of x and the
denominator of y.
也就是x的分母乘以y的分母

171
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,480
Like that.
像这样

172
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,050


173
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,500
OK?
好

174
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,480
So there is the analog of doing
这就是对有理数加法的一个模拟

175
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,710
rational number addition.
这就是对有理数加法的一个模拟

176
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,030
And it's no problem at
all, assuming that
在假设我们有了这些云彩后

177
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,280
we have these clouds.
就变得完全没有问题

178
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,020


179
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,810
And of course, we can do
当然 我们可以用同样的方法把它们乘起来

180
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,250
multiplication in the same way.

181
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,570


182
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,030
Define how to get the product
of two rational
我们把将两个有理数乘起来的过程

183
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,080
numbers, call it *RAT.
定义为*RAT

184
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:20,950
Takes in two of these clouds, x
and y, it returns a rational
该过程需要两朵云彩 x和y

185
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:27,100
number, make-RAT, whose
numerator is the product of
返回一个用MAKE-RAT构造的有理数

186
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,350
the numerators--
这个有理数的分子是

187
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,270


188
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:38,170
numerator of x times
the numerator of y.
x的分子与y的分子之积

189
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,780
And the denominator of the thing
it's going to return is
而这个有理数的分母则是

190
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,030
the product of the
denominators.
x的分母与y的分母之积

191
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:57,930


192
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,550
Well, except that I haven't
told you what these clouds

193
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,510
are, that's all there
is to it.

194
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,280
See, what did I do?

195
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,510
I assumed by wishful thinking
that I had a new
我按照我的期许假设我有

196
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,490
kind of data object.
一种新的数据类型

197
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,780
And in particular, I assumed I
had ways of creating these
特别的 我假设我有创建这些数据类型的能力

198
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,360
data objects.

199
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,140
Make-RAT creates one
of these things.
这里的MAKE-RAT就创建了一个新的数据类型

200
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,390
This is called a constructor.
这叫作“构造函数”

201
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:25,720


202
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,750
All right, I have a thing that
constructs such data objects.
我现在有了可以构造这些数据类型的东西了

203
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,370
And then I assume I have things
that, having made these
然后我假设我有某些东西 有了这些东西后

204
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,940
things, I have ways of getting
the parts out.
我就可以从中抽取部分信息的方法了

205
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,550
Those are called selectors.
这些叫作“选择函数”

206
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:42,850


207
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,750
And so formally, what I said is
I assumed I had procedures
把之前我所说的更加正式化一点 就是说

208
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,450
that are constructors and
selectors for these data
我假设我有了用于处理这些数据类型的构造函数和选择函数

209
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,090
objects, and then I went
off and used them.
那我就可以使用它们 # TBD - Went off

210
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,010
That's no different in kind from
saying I assume I have a
这就和我说我假设

211
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,240
procedure good-enough,
and I go use it to
我有GOOD-ENOUGH?过程 并用它来

212
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,490
implement square root.
实现平方根这种做法没有区别

213
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,850


214
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,940
OK, well before we go on, let's
ask the question of why
好 在我们继续之前

215
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,660
do we want to do this
in the first place?
让我们来想想 为什么我们首先就在这个地方实现了这些东西？

216
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,170
See, why do we want a procedure
like +RAT that takes
为什么我们需要一个像+RAT一样的过程

217
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:20,340
in two rational numbers and
returns a rational number?
一个需要两个有理数作为参数并返回一个有理数的过程

218
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,140
See, another way to think about
this is, well, here's
换一种想法就是

219
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,390
this formula.
我们实现的是这里的这个公式

220
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,160


221
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,060
And I've also got to implement
something that
这里我也实现了用于

222
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,890
adds rational numbers.
加和两个有理数的东西

223
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,240
One other way to think about is,
well, there's this thing,
再换一种想法就是 这有这么一个东西

224
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,850
and I type in four numbers,
an n1, and a d1, and
可以让我输入四个数 n1 d1

225
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,600
an n2, and a d2.
n2 d2

226
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,610
And it sets some registers in
the machine to this numerator
然后这个东西就修改机器里的寄存器

227
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,440
and this denominator.
来代表分子和分母

228
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,380
So I might say, well, why don't
I just add rational
所以你大概会问

229
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,640
numbers by I type in four
numbers, numerators and
你为什么不用四个分别代表分子和分母的数

230
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,950
denominators, and get out two
numbers, which is a numerator
来做有理数加法

231
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,000
and a denominator.
这个加法返回两个数 分别代表分子和分母

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,020
Why are we worrying
about building
我们为什么要关心像这样构造东西？ #TBD

233
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,270
things like this anyway?

234
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,620


235
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,390
Well, the answer is, suppose
you want to think about
呃 那是因为

236
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,620
expressing something like this,
suppose I'd like to
假设你想表达像这样的东西

237
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:14,840
express the idea of taking two
rational numbers, x plus y,
假设我想表达“采用”两个有理数的思想

238
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,720
say, and multiplying that
by the sum of two
x加y的和乘以s加上t的和

239
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,670
other rational numbers.

240
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,650
Well, the way I do it, having
things like +RAT and *RAT, is
然而 当我有了像+RAT和*RAT这样的东西后

241
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,930
I'd say, oh yeah, what that
is is just the product.
我就会将其考虑为乘积

242
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:51,570
That's *RAT of the sum of x and
y and the sum of s and t.
就是将*RAT应用于x和y的和以及s和t的和上

243
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:57,710
So except for syntax, I get an
expression that looks like the
除了语法 我还能得到一个表达式 # TBD

244
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,490
way I want to think about
it mathematically.
这个表达式看起来像是按照数学思想表达的

245
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,080
I want to say there
are two numbers.
我说这有两个数

246
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,060
There's a thing which is the
sum of them, and there's a
这个东西代表了这两个数的和

247
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,490
thing which is the
sum of these two.
然而这个东西又代表了另两个数的和

248
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,780
That's this and this.
就是这个和这个

249
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,530
And then I multiply them.
然后我把它们乘起来

250
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,640
So I get an expression that
matches this expression.
所以我有了一个和这里的表达式相匹配的表达式

251
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,720
If I did the other thing, if I
said, well, the way I want to
而如果我用其它的方式去表达

252
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,770
think about this is I type into
my machine four numbers,
我表达为 我传递向机器传递四个数

253
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,140
which are the numerators and the
denominators of x and y,
四个分别代表x和y的分子、分母的数

254
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,540
and then four more numbers,
which are the numerators and
然后又是四个分别代表s和t的分子、分母的数

255
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,140
denominators of s and t.


256
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,460
And then what I'd be sitting
with is, well,

257
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,340
what would I do?

258
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,380
I'd add these, and somehow I'd
have to have two temporary
我把这些加起来 不知咋的我们就得到了两个临时变量

259
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,090
variables, which are the
numerators and denominators of
分别代表了和的分子、分母

260
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,710
this sum, and I'd go off and
store them someplace.
我又得去找个地方把它们存储起来

261
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,500


262
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,670
And then I'd go over here, I'd
type in four more numbers, I'd
然后到了这里 我又传入了四个数

263
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,140
get two more temporary
variables, which are the
我又有了两个临时变量

264
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,180
numerators and denominators
of s and t.
分别代表了s和t之和的分子和分母

265
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,000
And then finally, I put those
together by multiplying them.
最后 我通过把它们乘起来来将其结合在一起

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,890
You see, what's starting to
happen, there are all these
如你所见 麻烦出来了

267
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,450
temporary variables, which are
sort of the guts of the
这里满是临时变量

268
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,320
internals of these rational
numbers that start hanging out
这些应该是这些有理数内部的“内脏”吧

269
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,190
all over the system.
但却显露在我们的系统中

270
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,050
And of course, if I had more
and more complicated
当然 随着表达式变得越来越复杂

271
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,380
expressions, there'd be more and
more guts hanging out that
这些“内脏”就会显露得越来越多

272
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,010
confuse my programming.
使我编程时感到困惑

273
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,920
And those of you who sort of
programmed things like that,
像这样写程序的人

274
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,440
where you're just adding numbers
in assembly language,
你只是在用汇编语言的思想来加和两数

275
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,280
you sort of see you have to
suddenly be concerned with

276
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,040
these temporary variables.
而这些对我大脑造成的困惑

277
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,350
But more importantly than
confusing my programming,
要比对编程造成的困惑更严重

278
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,760
they're going to confuse
my mind.

279
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,700
Because the whole name of this
game is that we'd like the

280
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,750
programming language to express
the concepts that we
我们希望程序设计语言能够表达

281
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,350
have in our heads, like rational
numbers are things
我们脑中的概念 有理数就是这些概念

282
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,770
that you can add and then take
that result and multiply them.
我们可以先把它们加起来然后再乘起来

283
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,760


284
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,010
Let's break for questions.
有疑问吗？

285
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:59,570


286
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah?
恩

287
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,240
AUDIENCE: I don't quite see the
need- when we had make-RAT
学生：我不太明白为什么

288
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,150
with the numerator and
denominator, we had to have
既然我们有MAKE-RAT过程了

289
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,590
the numerator and denominator
to pass as parameters to
我们将传递两个参数作为分子和分母来构造一朵云彩

290
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,420
create the cloud, and then we
extracted to get back what we
但最后我们又从中将这些东西给抽取出来

291
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,720
had to have originally.

292
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,740
PROFESSOR: That's right.
教授：非常正确

293
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,310
So the question is, I sort of
have the numerator and the
我们的问题是 既然我们是用分子和分母构造云彩

294
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,690
denominator, why am I worrying
about having the cloud given
但我为什么又想从云彩里面把它们取出来呢？

295
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,500
that I have to get
the pieces out?

296
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,310
That's sort of what I tried to
say at the end, but let me try
这个是我在后面提到过的

297
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,250
and say it again,
because that's
不过让我再说一次吧

298
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,390
really the crucial question.
这个问题非常关键

299
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,540
The point is, I want to carry
this numerator and denominator
关键点就是

300
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,816
around together all the time.
我想让分子和分母总是在一起

301
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,570
And it's almost as if I want
to know, yeah, there's a
这里面有分子和分母

302
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,350
numerator and denominator in
there, but also, I would like
同样的 我也想表达

303
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:50,180
to say, fine, but from another
point of view, that's x.
但是 从另一个角度来看 这就是x

304
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,040
And I carry x around, and I name
it as x, and I hold it.
我可以取用x 我给它命名为x hold # TBD

305
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,520
And I can say things like, the
sum of x and y, rather than
然后我就可以说 x加上y的和

306
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,180
just have-- see, it's not so bad
when I only think about x,
我只考虑一个x的时候 使用代表分子和分母的数并无大碍

307
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,360
but if I have a system with 10
rational numbers, suddenly I
但是当我有10个有理数时

308
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,770
have 20 numerators and
denominators, which are not
如果我不把它们联系起来

309
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,930
necessarily--
我一下子就有了20个不必要的分子和分母

310
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,609
if I don't link them, then it's
just 20 arbitrary numbers
它们只是20个没有以一种特定方式联系起来的任意数而已

311
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,560
that are not linked in
any particular way.
它们只是20个没有以一种特定方式联系起来的任意数而已

312
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,400
It's a lot like saying, well, I
have these instructions that
这就像是说 这里我有

313
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,099
are the body of the procedures,
why do I want to
这些过程体的指令 为什么我把它们

314
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,970
package them and say
it's the procedure?
封装起来作为一个过程

315
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,220
It's exactly the same idea.
这是一码子事儿

316
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:31,875


317
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,840
No?
没问题了

318
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,120
OK.
好吧

319
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,870
Let's break, let's just stretch
and get somebody--
那休息一下 活动一下吧

320
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,349
[INAUDIBLE]
[听不清]

321
00:17:38,349 --> 00:18:27,080
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[音乐]

322
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,790
OK, well, we've been working
on this rational number
好吧 回到我们的有理数算术系统来

323
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,590
arithmetic system, and then
what we did, the important
而我们所做的 最重要的则是

324
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,430
thing about what we did, is we
thought about the problem by
我们我们把这个问题分解为了两部分

325
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,160
breaking it into two pieces.
我们我们把这个问题分解为了两部分

326
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,580
We said, assume there is this
contract with George, and
我们假设我们跟George“签了合同”

327
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,200
George has figured out the way
to how to construct these
George已经给出了如何去构造这些云彩

328
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,900
clouds, provided us procedures
make-RAT, which was a
他给我们提供了一个作为构造函数的MAKE-RAT过程

329
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,340
constructor, and selectors,
which are numerator and
相应的 用于提取分子和分母的选择函数

330
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,040
denominator.

331
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,580
And then in terms of that, we
went off and implemented
然后 我们用这些东西

332
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,630
addition and multiplication
of rational numbers.
我们实现了有理数的加法和乘法

333
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,640
Well, now let's go look
at George's problem.
好了 我们来看看George面临的问题吧

334
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,910
How can we go and package
together a numerator and a
我们如何来把分子和分母给封装起来

335
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,360
denominator and actually make
one of these clouds?
并把它们放在“云彩”里

336
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,760
See, what we need is a kind of
glue, a glue for data objects
我们需要的是一种胶水

337
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,040
that allows us to put
things together.
一种可以让我们把数据结合在一起的胶水

338
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,170
And Lisp provides such
a glue, and that glue
Lisp提供了这样的胶水

339
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,420
is called list structure.
我们把它叫作“表结构”

340
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,410


341
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,700
List structure is a way of
gluing things together, and
表结构是一种将数据粘合在一起的工具

342
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,750
more precisely, Lisp provides
a way of constructing things
说得更准确一点 就是Lisp提供了一种叫序对的构造方法 #TBD

343
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,000
called pairs.

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,750


345
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:52,222
There's a primitive operator
in Lisp called cons.
Lisp里面有一个叫CONS的基本过程

346
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:54,920
We can take a look at it.
让我们来看一下

347
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,170
There's a thing called cons.
这个就是CONS

348
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,620


349
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,880
Cons is an operator which takes
in two arguments called
CONS是一个运算符 它需要两个参数X和Y

350
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,800
x and y, and it returns for
us a thing called a pair.
它返回给我们一个叫作“序对”的东西

351
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,510


352
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:17,520
All right, so a thing called a
pair that has a first part a
而所谓的“序对” 就是指它有“首部分”和“次部分” #TBD

353
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,770
second part.

354
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,250


355
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,450
So cons takes two objects.
这也解释了为什么CONS需要两个参数

356
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,780
There's a thing called a pair.
如果我们有一个序对的话

357
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,700
The first part of the cons
is x, and the second part
X就是首部分 而Y就是次部分

358
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,600
of the cons is y.

359
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,090
And that's what it builds.
这就是它的构造方式        

360
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,740
And then we also assume
we have ways of
我们同样也有把东西取出来的方法

361
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,880
getting things out.

362
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,820
If you're given a pair, there's
a thing called car,
给定一个序对 我们有一个叫CAR的东西

363
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,760
and car of a pair, p, gives
you out the first part
使得 序对P的CAR就是序对P的首部分

364
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,640
of the pair, p.

365
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,650
And there's a thing called cdr,
and cdr of the pair, p,
也有一个叫CDR的东西

366
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,310
gives you the second part
of the pair, p.
而序对P的CDR 就返回序对P的次部分

367
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,710
OK, so that's how we
construct things.
这些就是我们构造数据的方法

368
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,720
There's also a conventional
way of drawing pictures of
在将这些数据用图画表示时

369
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,800
these things.
我们也有一种俗成的方法

370
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,070
Just like we write down that
as the conventional way of

371
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:17,480
writing Plato's idea of two,
the way we could draw a

372
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,510
diagram to represent cons of
two and three is like this.

373
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,912
We draw a little box.
先画个小盒子

374
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:27,140
And so here's the box we're
talking about, and this box
这个就是我们讨论的（序对）

375
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,070
has two arrows coming
out of it.
它用两个从中放出的箭头 #TBD

376
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,890
And say the first part of this
pair is 2, and the second part
我们说 这个序对的首部分是2

377
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,250
of this pair is 3.
而这个序对的次部分是3

378
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,180
And this notation has
a name, it's called
这种记法叫作

379
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,855
box and pointer notation.
“盒子—指针”记法

380
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:56,050


381
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,340
By the way, let me say right now
that a lot of people get
顺带一提 我现在就来说说

382
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,650
confused that there's some
significance to the geometric

383
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,640
way I drew these pointers,
the directions.

384
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,090
Like some people think it'd be
different if I took this
一些人可能会认为 如果我这样画箭头

385
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,660
pointer and turned it up here,
and put the 3 out here.
并把3放在这里 结果会不一样

386
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,760
That has no significance.
这实际上是没区别的

387
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:10,940
All right?
能理解吗？

388
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,240
It's merely you have a bunch
of arrows, these

389
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,090
pointers, and the boxes.

390
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,860
The only issue is how they're
connected, not the geometric
唯一的区别就在于它们是如何链接的

391
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,400
arrangement of whether
I write the pointer
而不是我把它们怎么放置

392
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,160
across, or up, or down.
譬如向上放 向下放 或者交叉放

393
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,700
Now it's completely un-obvious,
probably, why

394
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,870
that's called list structure.

395
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,420
We're not actually going to
talk about that today.
我们今天不会讨论这个问题

396
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,850
We'll see that next time.
我们下次再讨论吧

397
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:37,870


398
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,740
So those are pairs, there's
cons that constructs them.
所以 我们可以用CONS构造序对

399
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,640
And what I'm going to know about
cons, and car, and cdr,

400
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,420
is precisely that if I have any
x and y, all right, if I

401
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:59,420
have any things x and y, and I
use cons to construct a pair,
对任意的X和Y 我可以用CONS来构造一个序对

402
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,090
then the car of that pair is
going to be x, the thing I put
那么该序对的CAR就是X 就是我的构造时的一个输入

403
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,790
in, and the cdr of that
pair is going to be y.
而该序对的CDR就是Y

404
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:12,360
That's the behavior of these
operators, cons, car, and cdr.
这就是CONS、CAR、CDR这些运算符的行为

405
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,870
Given them, it's pretty clear
how George can go off and
有了这些东西 George构造有理数就明了多了

406
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,520
construct his rational
numbers.

407
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,390
After all, all he has to do--
言归正传 

408
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,710
remember George's problem was
to implement make-RAT,
记得吗 George的任务是实现MAKE-RAT、

409
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,320
numerator, and denom.
NUMER、DENOM过程

410
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:34,980
So all George has to do is
say define make-RAT of
George这样编写代码

411
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,110
some n and a d--
定义用N和D来MAKE-RAT

412
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,710
so all I have to do
is cons them.
就是将CONS应用于这二者

413
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,790
That's cons of n and d.
也就是(CONS N D)

414
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,570


415
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,300
And then if I want to get the
numerator out, I would say
而如果我想取出分子

416
00:23:48,300 --> 00:24:00,260
define the numerator, numer,
of some rational number, x.
代码我这样写 定义有理数X的NUMER

417
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,010
If the rational number's
implemented as a pair, then
如果我们是用序对来实现有理数的话

418
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,190
all I have to do is get
out the car of x.
我只需要用CAR来获得X的首部分

419
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:19,350
And then similarly, define the
denom is going to be the cdr,
类似的 DENOM就是用CDR运算符了

420
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,430
the other thing I put
into the pair.
也就是我用于构造序对的另一个数据

421
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:27,080


422
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,960
Well, now we're in business.

423
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,530
That's a complete
这就是有理数的一种实现

424
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,810
implementation of rational numbers.
这就是有理数的一种实现

425
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,410
Let's use it.
我们来实践一下

426
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,270
Suppose I want to say, so I want
to think about how to add
假设我想要

427
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:43,470
1/2 plus 1/4 and watch
the system work.
我想要求取1/2加上1/4 并观察系统是怎么运作的

428
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:50,780
Well, the way I'd use that is
I'd say, well, maybe define a.
那么 我或许会定义一个A

429
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,080
I have to make a 1/2.
我需要构造一个1/2

430
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,980
Well, that's a rational number
with numerator 1 and
也就是一个分子为1 分母为2的有理数

431
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,090
denominator 2, so a will
be make-RAT of 1 and 2.
也就是 A为(MAKE-RAT 1 2)

432
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:05,490


433
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,770
And then I'll construct
the 1/4.
然后我来构造1/4

434
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:20,560
I'll say define d to be
make-RAT of 1 and 4.
我定义B为(MAKE-RAT 1 4)

435
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,362


436
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:25,440
And if I'd like to look
at the answer--
如果我想解得答案的话

437
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,710
well, assuming I don't have a
special thing that prints
先假设我们没有一个专门用于打印有理数的东西

438
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,100
rational numbers, or
I could make one--
我可以自己编写一个

439
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:41,622
I could say, for instance,
define the answer to be +RAT
比如说 我可以这样写 定义答案为(+RAT A B)

440
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:47,790
of a and b, and now I can
say, what's the answer?
那么我就可以问 答案是多少？

441
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,900
What are the numerators and
denominators of the answer?
答案的分子和分母分别是多少？

442
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,520
So if I'm adding 1/2 and 1/4,
I'll say, what is the
因此 我把1/2和1/4加起来后 我会问

443
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,440
numerator of the answer?
答案的分子是多少？

444
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,230


445
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,880
And the system is going
to type out, well, 6.
这个系统就应该打印出 6

446
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,250
Bad news.
糟糕了

447
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:22,790
And if I say what's the
denominator of the answer, the
而如果我问答案的分母是多少

448
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,430
system's going to type out 8.
系统就应该打印出8

449
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,400
So instead of what I would
really like, which is for it
我们本来希望能得到

450
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,550
to say that 1/2 and 1/4 is 3/4,
this foolish machine is
1/2加1/4是3/4

451
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,450
going to say, no, it's 6/8.
但这台愚蠢的机器却说 不 应该是6/8

452
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, that's sort of bad news.
恩 这的确有点糟糕

453
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,650
Where's the bug?
问题在哪里呢？

454
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,280


455
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,780
Why does it do that,
after all?

456
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,400
Well, it's the way that
we just had +RAT.
问题出在+RAT上

457
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,220
+RAT just took the--
+RAT只是

458
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,510
it said you add the numerator
times the denominator, you add
把A的分子和B分母之积与

459
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,230
that to the numerator times the
denominator, and put that
B的分子和A的分母之积加在一起

460
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,140
over the product of the two
denominators, and that's why
并把它们除以两分母之积

461
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,890
you get 6/8.
这就是为什么得到6/8的原因

462
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,640
So what was wrong with our
implementation of +RAT?
那么 我们的+RAT实现有什么问题呢？

463
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,110
What's wrong with that rational
number arithmetic
我们在此之前所做的

464
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,880
stuff that we did before
the break?
有理数算术又有什么错误呢？

465
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,730
Well, the answer is one way to
look at it is absolutely
当然 从一方面来看

466
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,730
nothing's wrong.
这一点都没有错

467
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,070
That's perfectly good
implementation.
这其实是一个相当好的实现

468
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:26,285
It follows the sixth grade,
fifth grade mathematic for
这个实现完完全全遵守了分数加法法则

469
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,535
adding fractions.

470
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:30,000


471
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,310
One thing we can say is, well,
that's George's problem.
我们可以这样说 这就是George的问题了

472
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,030
Like, boy, wasn't George dumb
to say that he can make a

473
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,960
rational number simply by
sticking together the

474
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,900
numerator and the denominator?

475
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,910
Wouldn't it be better for
George, when he made a
在构造有理数时 如果George把这些东西化到最简

476
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,970
rational number, to reduce the
stuff to lowest terms?
难道不是会跟好一点吗？

477
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,750
And what I mean is, wouldn't
it be better for George,
我想说的是 对George来说

478
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:01,300
instead of using this version
of make-RAT, to use this one
用这个版本的MAKE-RAT 难道会比幻灯片上的这个好么？

479
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,580
on the slide?

480
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,190
Or instead of just saying cons
together n and d, what you do
不是简单的通过CONS 把N和D结合起来

481
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,650
is compute the greatest common
divisor of n and d, and gcd is
我们先寻找N和D的最大公约数

482
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,540
the procedure which, well, for
all we care is a primitive,
我们用GCD过程来找 我们只需知道GCD是一个基本过程

483
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,628
which computes the greatest
common divisor of two numbers.
它返回的是两个数的最大公约数

484
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:24,890
So the way I can construct a
rational number is get the
因此 这种构造有理数的方法就是

485
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,140
greatest common divisor of the
two numbers, and I'm going to
先找到两数的最大公约数

486
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,000
call that g, and then instead
of consing together n and d,
先用G来表示吧 不是简单通过CONS结合N、D

487
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll divide them through.
而是先让它们除以G 

488
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,630
I'll cons together the quotient
of n by the the gcd
然后我再用CONS结合N/G和D/G的商

489
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,510
and the quotient of
d by the gcd.

490
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,540
And that will reduce the
rational number to lowest
这样就把我们的有理数化到了最简

491
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:49,200
terms. So when I do
this addition,
因此 当我在做加法时

492
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,330
when +RAT calls make-RAT--
当+RAT调用MAKE-RAT过程时

493
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,810
and for the definition of +RAT
it had a make-RAT in there--

494
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,880
just by the fact that it's
constructing that, the thing

495
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,425
will get reduced to lowest
terms automatically.

496
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:09,612


497
00:29:09,612 --> 00:29:15,180
OK, that is a complete system.

498
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,780
For rational number arithmetic,
let's look at what

499
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,590
we've done.

500
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,440
All right, we said we want
to build rational number

501
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,230
arithmetic, and we had
a thing called +RAT.

502
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,940
We implemented that.

503
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,660
And I showed you multiplying
rational numbers, and although

504
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,570
I didn't put them up there,
presumably we'd like to have

505
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,860
something that subtracts
rational numbers, and I don't

506
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,770
know, all sorts of things.

507
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,120
Things that test equality in
division, and maybe things

508
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,190
that print rational numbers
in some particular way.

509
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:52,330
And we implemented those
in terms of pairs.

510
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,800
These pairs, cons, car, and cdr
that are built into Lisp.

511
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:05,100
But the important thing is that
between these and these,

512
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,622
we set up an abstraction
barrier.

513
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:09,260
We set up a layer
of abstraction.

514
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:17,310


515
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,190
And what was that layer
of abstraction?

516
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,140
That layer of abstraction was
precisely the constructor and

517
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,390
the selectors.

518
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,630


519
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:34,730
This layer was make-RAT,
and numer, and denom.

520
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,970


521
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,670
This methodology, another way
to say what it's doing, is

522
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:53,960
that we are separating the way
something is used, separating

523
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,760
the use of data objects,
from the

524
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,350
representation of data objects.

525
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:07,650


526
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,010
So up here, we have the way
that rational numbers are

527
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,620
used, do arithmetic on them.

528
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,280
Down here, we have the way that
they're represented, and

529
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,950
they're separated by
this boundary.

530
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,605
The boundary is the constructors
and selectors.

531
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:23,760


532
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,920
And this methodology
has a name.

533
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,170
This is called data
abstraction.

534
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:35,820


535
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,030
Data abstraction is sort of the
programming methodology of

536
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,060
setting up data objects by
postulating constructors and

537
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,085
selectors to isolate use
from representation.

538
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:47,550


539
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,060
Well, so why?

540
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,750
I mean, after all, we didn't
have to do it this way.

541
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,450
It's perfectly possible to do
rational number addition

542
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,550
without having any compound data
objects, and here on the

543
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,060
slide is one example.

544
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,640
We certainly could have defined
+RAT, which takes in

545
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,830
things x and y, and we'll say,
well what are these rational

546
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,030
numbers really?

547
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,060
So really, they're just pairs,
and the numerator's the car

548
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,180
and the denominator's the cdr.
So what we'll do is we'll take

549
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:23,310
the car of x times the cdr
of y, multiply them.

550
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,470
Take the car of y times the
cdr of x, multiply them.

551
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,650
Add them.

552
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,960
Take the cdr of x and the cdr of
y, multiply them, and then

553
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,210
constitute together.

554
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,450


555
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,890
Well, that sort of does
the same thing.

556
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,560


557
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,930
But this ignores the problem of
reducing things to lowest

558
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,680
terms, but let's not worry
about that for a minute.

559
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,200
But so what?

560
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,790
Why don't we do it that way?

561
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:50,960
Right?

562
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,220
After all, there are sort of
fewer procedures to define,

563
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,470
and it's a lot more
straightforward.

564
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,210


565
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,610
It saves all this self-righteous
BS about

566
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,850
talking about data
abstraction.

567
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,270
We just sort of do it.

568
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,870
I mean, who knows, maybe it's
even marginally more efficient

569
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,930
depending on whatever compiler
were using for this.

570
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,500
What's the point of isolating
the use from the

571
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,910
representation?

572
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,130
Well, it goes back to this
notion of naming.

573
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,020
Remember, one of the most
important principles in

574
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,770
programming is the same as
one of the most important

575
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,660
principles in sorcery,
all right?

576
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,210
That's if you have the name
of the spirit, you get

577
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,330
control over it.

578
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,420
And if you go back and look at
the slide, you see what's in

579
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,580
there is we have this thing
+RAT, but nowhere in the

580
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,710
system, if I have a +RAT and a
-RAT and a *RAT, and things

581
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,870
that look like that, nowhere
in the system do I have a

582
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:50,770
thing that I can point at which
is a rational number.

583
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:53,550


584
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,480
I don't have, in a system like
that, the idea of rational

585
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,340
number as a conceptual entity.

586
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,270
Well, what's the advantage
of that?

587
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,200
What's the advantage of
isolating the idea of rational

588
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,400
numbers as a conceptual entity,
and really naming it

589
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,900
with make-RAT, numerator,
and denominator.

590
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,659
Well, one advantage is you might
want to have alternative

591
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,679
representations.

592
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,889
See, before I showed you that
one way George can solve this

593
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,280
things not reduced to lowest
terms problem, is when you

594
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,260
build a rational number, you
divide up by the greatest

595
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,190
common denominator.

596
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:36,650
Another way to do that
is shown over here.

597
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,810
I can have an alternative
representation for rational

598
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,980
numbers where when you make
a rational number,

599
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,409
you just cons them.

600
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:46,610
However, when you go to select
out the numerator, at that

601
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,929
point you compute the gcd of
the stuff that's sitting in

602
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,440
that pair, and divide
out by the gcd.

603
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,970


604
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,300
And similarly, when I get the
denominator, at that point

605
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,990
when I go to get the
denominator, I'll divide out

606
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,420
by the gcd.

607
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,090
So the difference would be in
the old representation, when

608
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:13,680
ans was constructed here, say
what's 6 and 8, in the first

609
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,260
way, the 6 and 8 would have
got reduced when they got

610
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,380
stuck into that pair, numerator
would select out 3.

611
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,850
And in the way I just showed
you, well, ans would get 6 and

612
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,650
8 put in, and then at the point
where I said numerator,

613
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,770
some computation would
get done to put out

614
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,590
3 instead of 6.

615
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,520
So those are two different
ways I might do it.

616
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,530
Which one's better?

617
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,460
Well, it depends, right?

618
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,230
If I'm making a system where
I am mostly constructing

619
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,240
rational numbers and hardly
ever looking at them, then

620
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,520
it's probably better not to do
that gcd computation when I

621
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,776
construct them.

622
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:51,070
If I'm doing a system where I
look at things a lot more than

623
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,470
I construct them, then it's
probably better to do the work

624
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,240
when I construct them.

625
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,170
So there's a choice there.

626
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:04,840
But the real issue is that you
might not be able to decide at

627
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,640
the moment you're worrying about
these rational numbers.

628
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:14,470
See, in general, as systems
designers, you're forced with

629
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,350
the necessity to make decisions
about how you're

630
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,640
going to do things, and in
general, the way you'd like to

631
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,720
retain flexibility is to never
make up your mind about

632
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,890
anything until you're
forced to do it.

633
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:31,730
The problem is, there's a very,
very narrow line between

634
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,765
deferring decisions and outright
procrastination.

635
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:38,760


636
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,860
So you'd like to make progress,
but also at the same

637
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,020
time, never be bound by the

638
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,620
consequences of your decisions.

639
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,550
Data abstraction's one
way of doing this.

640
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,540
What we did is we used
wishful thinking.

641
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,190
See, we gave a name
to the decision.

642
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,340
We said, make-RAT, numerator,
and denominator will stand for

643
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,040
however it's going to be done,
and however it's going to be

644
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,080
done is George's problem.

645
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,100
But really, what that was doing
is giving a name to the

646
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,030
decision of how we're going to
do it, and then continuing as

647
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,400
if we made the decision.

648
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,110
And then eventually, when we
really wanted it to work,

649
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,330
coming back and facing what
we really had to do.

650
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,080
And in fact, we'll see a couple
times from now that you

651
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,440
may never have to choose any
particular representation,

652
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,800
ever, ever.

653
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,230
Anyway, that's a very powerful
design technique.

654
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,295
It's the key to the reason
people use data abstraction.

655
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:34,830


656
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,854
And we're going to see that
idea again and again.

657
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:40,510
Let's stop for questions.

658
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,810
AUDIENCE: What does this
decision making through

659
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,500
abstraction layers do to the
axiom of do all your design

660
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,800
before any of your code?

661
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,700
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
someone's axiom, and I bet

662
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,990
that's the axiom of someone who
hasn't implemented very

663
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,600
large computer systems
very much.

664
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,220


665
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,116
I said that computer science is
a lot like magic, and it's

666
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,270
sort of good that
it's like magic.

667
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,690
There's a bad part of
computer science

668
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,746
that's a lot like religion.

669
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:13,570
And in general, I think people
who really believe that you

670
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,800
design everything before you
implement it basically are

671
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,440
people who haven't designed
very many things.

672
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,230


673
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,660
The real power is that you can
pretend that you've made the

674
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,640
decision and then later on
figure out which one is right,

675
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,550
which decision you ought
to have made.

676
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,870
And when you can do that, you
have the best of both worlds.

677
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,834


678
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,330
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
the difference

679
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,180
between let and define?

680
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,520
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

681
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,040
Let is a way to establish
local names.

682
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,150


683
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,430
Let me give you sort
of the half answer.

684
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,970
And I'll say, later on we can
talk about the whole very

685
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,960
complicated thing.

686
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,000
But the big difference for now
is that, see, when you're

687
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,020
typing at Lisp, you're typing
in this environment where

688
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,020
you're making definitions.

689
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,990
And when you say define a to be
5, if I say define a to be

690
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:25,640
5, then from then on the thing
will remember that a is 5.

691
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,460
Let is a way to set up a local
context where there's a

692
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,090
definition.

693
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:37,695
So if I type something like,
saying let a-- no, I

694
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:40,642
shouldn't say a--

695
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:50,480
if I said let z be 10, and
within that context, tell me

696
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,280
what the sum of z and z is.

697
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,780
So if I typed in this expression
to Lisp, and then

698
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,210
this would put out 20.

699
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:07,340
However, then if I said what's
z, the computer would say

700
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,910
that's an unbound variable.

701
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,710
So let is a way of setting up
a context where you can make

702
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,320
definitions.

703
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,320
But those definitions are
local to this context.

704
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:27,990
And of course, if I'd said a
in here, I'd still get 20.

705
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:33,960
But this a would not interfere
at all with this one.

706
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,210
So if I type this, and then type
this, and then say what's

707
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,160
a? a will still be 5.

708
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,220
So there's some other subtle
differences between let and

709
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,543
define, but that's the
most important one.

710
00:40:44,543 --> 00:41:20,090


711
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,980
All right, well, we've looked
at implementing this little

712
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,470
system for doing arithmetic on
rational numbers as an example

713
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,096
of this methodology of
data abstraction.

714
00:41:31,096 --> 00:41:34,430
And that's a way of controlling
complexity in

715
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,530
large systems. But, see, like
procedure definition, and like

716
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,420
all the ways we're going to
talk about for controlling

717
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,660
complexity, the real power of
these things show up not when

718
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,370
you sort of do these things in
themselves, like it's not such

719
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,430
a great thing that we've done
rational number arithmetic,

720
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,150
it's that you can use these as
building blocks for making

721
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,620
more complicated things.

722
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,460
So it's no wonderful idea that
you can just put two numbers

723
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,265
together to form a pair.

724
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:06,890
If that's all you ever wanted to
do, there are tons of ways

725
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,450
that you can do that.

726
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,910
The real issue is can you do
that in such a way so that the

727
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,420
things that you build become
building blocks for doing

728
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,945
something even more complex?

729
00:42:16,945 --> 00:42:19,120
So whenever someone shows you
a method for controlling

730
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,080
complexity, you should say,
yeah, that's great, but what

731
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,330
can I build with it?

732
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,290


733
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:30,490
So for example, let me just
run through another thing

734
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,090
that's a lot like the
rational number one.

735
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,760
Suppose we would like to
represent points in the plane.

736
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,130
You sort of say, well, there's
a point, and we're going to

737
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,810
call that point p.

738
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:48,810
And that point might have
coordinates, like this might

739
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,330
be the point 1 comma 2.

740
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,500
The x-coordinate might
be 1, and it's

741
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,370
y-coordinate might be 2.

742
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,310
And we'll make a little system
for manipulating

743
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,450
points in the plane.

744
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,040
And again, we can do
that-- here's a

745
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,290
little example of that.

746
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,070


747
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,080
It can represent vectors, the
same as points in the plane,

748
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:17,550
and we'll say, yep, there's
a constructor called

749
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,100
make-vector, make-vector's going
to take two coordinates,

750
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,280
and here we can implement them
if we like as pairs, but the

751
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,120
important thing is that
there's a constructor.

752
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,890
And then given some vector, p,
we can find its x-coordinate,

753
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,540
or we can get its
y-coordinate.

754
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,270
So there's a constructor
and selectors for

755
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,010
points in the plane.

756
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,310
Well, given points in the plane,
we might want to use

757
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,420
them to build something.

758
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,730
So for instance, we might want
to talk about, we might have a

759
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:51,220
point, p, and a point, q, and p
might be the point 1, 2, and

760
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,790
q might be the point 2, 3.

761
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,970
And we might want to talk about
the line segment that

762
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,570
starts at p and ends at q.

763
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:05,180
And that might be
the segment s.

764
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:12,300
So we might want to build points
for vectors in terms of

765
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,410
numbers, and segments
in terms of vectors.

766
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,240
So we can represent
line segments in

767
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,920
exactly the same way.

768
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,300
All right, so the line segment
from p to q, we'll say there's

769
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,640
a constructor, make-segment.

770
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,010


771
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,270
And make up names for the
selectors, the starting point

772
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,560
of the segment and the ending
point of the segment.

773
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,290
And again, we can implement a
segment using cons as a pair

774
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:39,610
of points, and car and cdr get
out the two points that we put

775
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,860
together to get the segment.

776
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,820


777
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,520
Well, now having done that,
we can have some

778
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,920
operations on them.

779
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,610
Like we could say, what's the
midpoint of a line segment?

780
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,540
So here's the midpoint of a line
segment, that's going to

781
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,880
be the points whose coordinates
are the averages

782
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,310
of the coordinates
of the endpoints.

783
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,170
OK, there's the midpoint.

784
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,290
So to get the midpoint of a line
segment, s, we'll just

785
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:18,240
say grab the starting point to
the segment, grab the ending

786
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,640
point of the segment, and
now make a vector--

787
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,480
make a point whose coordinates
are the average of the

788
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,510
x-coordinate of the first point
and the x-coordinate of

789
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,930
the second point, and whose
y-coordinate is the average of

790
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,530
the y-coordinates.

791
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,810
So there's an implementation
of midpoint.

792
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:42,400
And then similarly, we can
build something like the

793
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,450
length of the segment.

794
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,070
The length of the segment
is a thing whose--

795
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,410


796
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,000
use Pythagoras's rule, the
length of the segment is the

797
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,100
square root of the d x squared
plus d y squared.

798
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,200
We'll say to get the length of
a line segment, we'll let dx

799
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:09,030
be the difference of the
x-coordinate of one endpoint

800
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,180
and the x-coordinate of the
other endpoint, and we'll let

801
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,260
dy be the difference of
the y-coordinates.

802
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,290
And then we'll take the square
root of the sum of the squares

803
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,251
of dx and dy, that's
what this says.

804
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:26,190
All right, so there's an
implementation of length.

805
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:35,760
And again, what we built
is a layered system.

806
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,730
We built a system which
has, well, say up

807
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,980
here there's segments.

808
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:47,430


809
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,530
And then there's an abstraction
barrier.

810
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:56,880
The abstraction barrier
separates the implementation

811
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,000
of segments from the
implementation of vectors and

812
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,950
points, and what that
abstraction barrier is are the

813
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,260
constructors and selectors.

814
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:14,340
It's make-segment, and
segment-start, and

815
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,590
segment-end.

816
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,030


817
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,120
And then there are vectors.

818
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,600
And vectors in turn are built
on top of pairs and numbers.

819
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,670
So I'll say pairs and numbers.

820
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,250
And that has its own abstraction
barrier, which is

821
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:42,350
make-vector, and x-coordinate,
and y-coordinate.

822
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:46,920


823
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,930
So we have, again,
a layered system.

824
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,080
You're starting to see that
there are layers here.

825
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:58,080
I ought to mention, there is a
very important thing that I

826
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,330
kind of took for granted.

827
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,016


828
00:48:02,016 --> 00:48:06,700
And it's sort of so natural, but
on the other hand it's a

829
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,580
very important thing.

830
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:12,070
Notice that in order to
represent this segment s, I

831
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,600
said this segment is
a pair of points.

832
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,120
And a point is a pair
of numbers.

833
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,180
And if I were going to draw the
box and pointers structure

834
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,180
for that, I would say, oh, the
segment is, given those

835
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,900
particular representations that
I showed you, I'd say

836
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:38,070
this segment s is a pair, and
the first thing in the pair is

837
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:45,430
a vector, and the vector
is a pair of numbers.

838
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,000
And that's this, that's p.

839
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,190


840
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:55,330
And the other thing in the
segment is q, which is itself

841
00:48:55,330 --> 00:49:00,100
a pair of numbers.

842
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,070
So I almost took it for granted
when I said that cons

843
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:08,960
allows you to put
things together.

844
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,110
But it's very easy to not
appreciate that, because

845
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:17,650
notice, some of the things
I can put together can

846
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,720
themselves be pairs.

847
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,510
And let me introduce a word that
I'll talk about more next

848
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,915
time, it's one of my favorite
words, called closure.

849
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:30,640


850
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,180
And by closure I mean that the
means of combination in your

851
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,390
system are such that when you
put things together using

852
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,430
them, like we make a pair, you
can then put those together

853
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,080
with the same means
of combination.

854
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,120
So I can have not only a pair
of numbers, but I can have a

855
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,370
pair of pairs.

856
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,710


857
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:58,070
So for instance, making arrays
in a language like Fortran is

858
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,120
not a closed means of
combination, because I can

859
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,200
make an array of numbers,
but I can't

860
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,450
make an array of arrays.

861
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,790


862
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:09,060
And one of the things that you
should ask, one of your tests

863
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,430
of quality for a means of
combination that someone shows

864
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,500
you, is gee, are the things
you make closed under that

865
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,340
means of combination?

866
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,290
So pairs would not be nearly so
interesting if all I could

867
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,160
do was make a pair of numbers.

868
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,820
I couldn't build very much
structure at all.

869
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,170
OK, well, we'll come
back to that.

870
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,300
I just wanted to
mention it now.

871
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,170
You'll hear a lot about
closure later on.

872
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:38,520
You can also see the potential
for losing control of

873
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,310
complexity as you have a layered
system if you don't

874
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:44,030
use data abstraction.

875
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:48,130
Let's go back and look at
this slide for length.

876
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:53,190
Length works and is a simple
thing because I can say, when

877
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:56,450
I want to get this value, I
can say, oh, that is the

878
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:00,430
x-coordinate of the first
endpoint of the segment.

879
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,990


880
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,850
And each of these things,
each of these selectors,

881
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:09,190
x-coordinate and endpoint, stand
for a decision choice

882
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,260
whose details I don't
have to look at.

883
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,070
So I could perfectly well,
again, just like rational

884
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,910
numbers I did before, I could
say, oh well, gee, a segment

885
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:21,180
really is a pair of pairs.

886
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,810
And the x-coordinate of the
first endpoint or the segment

887
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,770
really is the--

888
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,330
well, what is it?

889
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:33,890
It's the car of the car
of the segment.

890
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,500
So I could perfectly well
go and redefine length.

891
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:48,614
I could say, define the length
of some segment s.

892
00:51:48,614 --> 00:51:51,050
And I could start off writing
something like, well, we'll

893
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:56,260
let dx be-- well, what's
it have to be?

894
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,380
It's got to be the difference
of the two coordinates, so

895
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:04,310
that's the difference of, the
first one is the car of the

896
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:13,070
car of s, subtracted from the
first one, the car of the

897
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,140
other half of it,
the cdr of s.

898
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:21,530


899
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,430
All right, and then
dy would be--

900
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,780
well, let's see, I'd get the
y-coordinate, so it'd be the

901
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:36,890
difference of the cdr of the car
of s, and the cdr of the

902
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:41,385
cdr of s, sort of go on.

903
00:52:41,385 --> 00:52:44,210


904
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,980
You can see that's much harder
to read than the

905
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,270
program I had before.

906
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:52,075
But worse than that,
suppose you'd gone

907
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:53,325
and implemented length?

908
00:52:53,325 --> 00:52:56,930


909
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:59,150
And then the next day, George
comes to you and says, I'm

910
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,030
sorry, I changed my mind.

911
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:05,390
I want to write points with the
x-coordinate first. So you

912
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,940
come back you stare at
this code and say, oh

913
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,750
gee, what was that?

914
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:15,510
That was the car, so I have to
change this to cdr, and this

915
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:20,770
is cdr, and this now
has to be car.

916
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,900
And this has to be car.

917
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,050
And you sort of do that, and
then the next day George comes

918
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:31,600
back and says, sorry, the guys
designing the display would

919
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,740
like lines to be painted in the
opposite direction, so I

920
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,630
have to write the endpoint
first in the order.

921
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,386
And then you come back and you
stare at this code, and say,

922
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:42,400
gee, what was it
talking about?

923
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,520
Oh yeah, well I've got to change
this one to cdr, and

924
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,500
this one becomes car, this one
comes car, and this becomes

925
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:50,620
cdr.

926
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,340
And you go up and do that, and
then the next day, George

927
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,270
comes back and says, I'm sorry,
what I really meant is

928
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:58,150
that the segments always have
to be painted from left to

929
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,660
right on the screen.

930
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,800
And then you sort of, it's
clear, you just go and punch

931
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,610
George in the mouth
at that point.

932
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:09,410
But you see, as soon as we have
a 10 layer system, you

933
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,050
see how that complexity
immediately builds up to the

934
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:16,250
point where even something like
this gets out of control.

935
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,470
So again, the way we've gotten
out of that is we've named

936
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,150
that spirit.

937
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:26,560
We built a system where there
is a thing, which is the

938
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,510
representation choice
for how you're going

939
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,570
to talk about vectors.

940
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,430
And choices about that
representation are localized

941
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,670
right there.

942
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,840
They don't have their guts
spilling over into things like

943
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,926
how you compute the length and
how you compute the midpoint.

944
00:54:40,926 --> 00:54:45,660
And that's the real power
of this system.

945
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,890
OK, we're explicit about
them, so that we have

946
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,916
control over them.

947
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,190
All right, questions?

948
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,685
AUDIENCE: What happens in the
case where you don't want to

949
00:54:54,685 --> 00:54:56,660
be treating objects
in terms of pairs?

950
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,590
For instance, in
three-dimensional space, you'd

951
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,680
have three coordinates.

952
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,740
Or even in the case
where you have

953
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,180
n-dimensional space, what happens?

954
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,140
PROFESSOR: Right, OK.

955
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:08,374
Well, this is a preview of
what I'll say tomorrow.

956
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:15,020
But the point is, once you have
two things, you have as

957
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,972
many things as you want.

958
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:17,370
All right?

959
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,970
Because if I want to make three
things, I could start

960
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:26,970
making things like a pair whose
first thing is 1, and

961
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:31,780
whose second thing is another
pair that, say,

962
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,582
has 2 and 3 in it.

963
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:35,760
And so on, a hundred things.

964
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,550
I can nest them out of pairs.

965
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,370
I made a pretty arbitrary
decision about how to do it,

966
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,770
and you can immediately
see there are lots

967
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:42,730
of ways to do that.

968
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,210
What we'll start talking about
next time are conventions for

969
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,660
how to do things like that.

970
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,730
But notice that what this really
depends on is I can

971
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,950
make pairs of pairs.

972
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,380
If all I could do was
make pairs of

973
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,630
numbers, I'd be stuck.

974
00:55:54,630 --> 00:56:07,140


975
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,236
OK.

976
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:11,960
Let's break.

977
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:55,580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

978
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,210
All right, well, we've just gone
off and done a couple of

979
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,575
simple examples of
data abstraction.

980
00:57:03,575 --> 00:57:05,695
Now I want to do something
more complicated.

981
00:57:05,695 --> 00:57:08,310
We're going to talk about
what it means.

982
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:11,590
And this will be harder, because
it's always much

983
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,450
harder in computer programming
to talk about what something

984
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:16,450
means than to go
off and do it.

985
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:22,070
But let's go back to almost
the very beginning.

986
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:27,050
Let's go back to the point where
I said, we just assumed

987
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:32,370
that there were procedures,
make-RAT,

988
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:38,480
and numer, and denom.

989
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,570
Let's go back to where we had
this, at the very beginning,

990
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:46,210
constructors and selectors,
and when often defined the

991
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,210
rational number arithmetic.

992
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,700
And remember, I said at that
point we were sort of done,

993
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,990
except for George.

994
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:55,920
Well, what is it that we'd
actually done at that point?

995
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,420
What was it that was done?

996
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,540
Well, what I want to say is,
what was done after we'd

997
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,540
implemented the operations and
terms of these, was that we

998
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,100
had defined a rational number
representation in terms of

999
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,390
abstract data.

1000
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:17,946


1001
00:58:17,946 --> 00:58:21,090
What do I mean by
abstract data?

1002
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:26,630
Well, the idea is that at that
point, when we had our +RAT

1003
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:32,115
and our *RAT, that any
implementation of make-RAT,

1004
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:38,000
and numerator, and denominator
that George supplied us with,

1005
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,520
could be the basis for
a rational number

1006
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,990
representation.

1007
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:44,550
Like, it wasn't our concern
where you divided through to

1008
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,980
get the greatest common
denominator, or any of that.

1009
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,830
So the idea is that what we
built is a rational arithmetic

1010
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,140
system that would sit on top
of any representation.

1011
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,930
What do I mean by any
representation?

1012
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,950
I mean, certainly it can't be
the case that all I mean is

1013
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,130
George can reach in a bag and
pull out three arbitrary

1014
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:10,380
procedures and say, well,
fine, now that's the

1015
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,960
implementation.

1016
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,080
That can't be what I mean.

1017
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,990
What I've got to mean is that
there's some way of saying

1018
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:23,950
whether three procedures are
going to be suitable as a

1019
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,690
basis for rational number
representation.

1020
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,750
If we think about it, what
suitable might mean is if I

1021
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:36,220
have to assume something like
this, I have to say that if x

1022
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:54,130
is the result of say, doing
make-RAT of n and d, then the

1023
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:06,400
numerator of x divided by
the denominator of x is

1024
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,680
equal to n over d.

1025
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,770
See, what that is is that's
George's contract.

1026
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:16,520
What we mean by writing a
contract for rational numbers,

1027
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,790
if you think about it, this
is the right thing.

1028
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,510
And the two ones we showed
do the right thing.

1029
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:25,720
See, if I'm taking out greatest
common divisors, it

1030
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,350
doesn't matter whether I take
them out or not, or the place

1031
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,830
where I take them, because
the idea is I'm

1032
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:32,380
going to divide through.

1033
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,930
But see, this is George's
contract.

1034
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,160
So what we really say to George
is your business is to

1035
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,703
go off and find us three
procedures, make-RAT, and

1036
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:45,810
numerator, and denominator, that
fulfill this contract for

1037
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:46,870
any choice of n and d.

1038
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:51,080
And that's what we mean by we
can use that as the basis for

1039
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,540
a rational number
representation.

1040
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,130
And other than that, it fulfills
this contract.

1041
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:59,292
We don't care how he does it.

1042
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:00,410
It's not our business.

1043
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,330
It's below the layer
of abstraction.

1044
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:07,010


1045
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,980
In fact, if we want
to say, what is a

1046
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,860
rational number really?

1047
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,240
See, what's it really, without
having to talk about going

1048
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,240
below the layer of abstraction,
what we're forced

1049
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:24,820
into saying is a rational number
really is sort of this

1050
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,830
axiom, is three procedures,
make-RAT, numerator, and

1051
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:32,370
denominator, that satisfy
this axiom.

1052
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,790
In some sense, abstractly,
that's what a

1053
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,080
rational number is really.

1054
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,490


1055
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,860
That's sort of easy words to
listen to, because what you

1056
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,190
have in your head, of course,
is well, for all this thing

1057
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:50,850
about saying that's what a
rational number is really, you

1058
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,950
actually just saw that we
built rational numbers.

1059
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:58,830


1060
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,230
See, what we really did
is we built rational

1061
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:04,230
numbers on top of pairs.

1062
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:08,680


1063
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,170
So for all I'm saying
abstractly, we can say a

1064
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:15,450
rational number really
is just this axiom.

1065
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,370
You can listen to that
comfortably, because you're

1066
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:20,510
saying, well, yeah, but really
it's actually pairs, and I'm

1067
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:24,820
just annoying you by trying
to be abstract.

1068
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:29,960
Well, let me, as an antidote for
that, let me do something

1069
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,636
that I think is really
going to terrify you.

1070
01:02:32,636 --> 01:02:36,920
I mean, it's really going to
bring you face to face with

1071
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,090
the sort of existential reality
of this abstraction

1072
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,490
that we're talking about.

1073
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,250
And what I'm going
to talk about is,

1074
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,960
what are pairs really?

1075
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,710
See, what did I tell
you about pairs?

1076
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,420
I tricked you, right?

1077
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,115
I said that Lisp has this
primitive called cons that

1078
01:02:52,115 --> 01:02:53,520
builds pairs.

1079
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,470
But what did I really
tell you about?

1080
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:00,060
If you go back and said, let's
look on this slide, all I

1081
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:04,090
really told you about pairs is
that there happens to be this

1082
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,220
property, these properties of
cons, car, and cdr. And all I

1083
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,840
really said about pairs is that
there's a thing called

1084
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,870
cons, and a thing called car,
and a thing called cdr.

1085
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:18,080
And it is the case that if I
build cons of x, y and take

1086
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,710
car of it, I get x.

1087
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:25,810
And if I build cons of x, y and
get cdr of it, I get y.

1088
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:31,670
And even though I lulled you
into thinking that there's

1089
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,890
something in Lisp that does
that, so you pretended you

1090
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,590
knew what it was, in fact, I
didn't tell you any more about

1091
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:39,750
pairs than this tells you
about rational numbers.

1092
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,050
It's just some axiom
for pairs.

1093
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,720


1094
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:51,880
Well, to drive that home, let me
really scare you, and show

1095
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:56,120
you what we might build
pairs in terms of.

1096
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,470
And what you're going to see is
that we can build rational

1097
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,960
numbers, and line segments, and
vectors, and all of this

1098
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,160
stuff in terms of pairs, and
we're going to see below here

1099
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,680
that pairs can be built
out of nothing at all.

1100
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,680
Pure abstraction.

1101
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:17,800
So let me show you on this slide
an implementation of

1102
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,080
cons, car, and cdr. And we'll
look at it again in a second,

1103
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,480
but notice that their procedure
definitions of cons,

1104
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,850
car, and cdr, you don't see any
data in there, what you

1105
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:34,720
see is a lambda.

1106
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,630
So cons here is going to
return-- is a procedure that

1107
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:44,630
returns a procedure, just like
average [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1108
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:49,050
Cons of a and b returns a
procedure of an argument

1109
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:55,265
called pick, and it says, if
pick is equal to 1, I'm going

1110
01:04:55,265 --> 01:04:59,220
to return a, and if pick is
equal to 2, I'm going to

1111
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,000
return b, and that's what
cons is going to be.

1112
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,810


1113
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:11,600
Car of a thing x, car of a
pair x, is going to be x

1114
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,320
applied to 1.

1115
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,470
And notice that makes sense.

1116
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,690
You might not understand why or
how I'm doing such a thing,

1117
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:19,820
but at least it makes sense,
because the thing constructed

1118
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:24,630
by cons is a procedure, and
car applies that to 1.

1119
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,370
And similarly, cdr applies
that thing to 2.

1120
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:33,290
OK, now I claimed that this is a
representation of cons, car,

1121
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,780
and cdr, and notice there's
no data in it.

1122
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,190
All right, it's built
out of air.

1123
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:39,600
It's just procedures.

1124
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,660
There's no data objects at all
in that representation.

1125
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,140
Well, what could that
possibly mean?

1126
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:49,690


1127
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:54,990
Well, if you really believe this
stuff, then you have to

1128
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:58,650
believe that in order to show
that that's a representation

1129
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:01,390
for cons, car, and cdr, all I
have to do is show that it

1130
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,550
satisfies the axiom.

1131
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,070
See, all I should have to
convince you of is, for

1132
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:23,760
example, that gee, that car of
cons of 37 and 49 is 37 for

1133
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,060
arbitrary values of 37 and 49.

1134
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,310
And cdr the same way.

1135
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,070


1136
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:35,050
See, if I really can demonstrate
to you that that

1137
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,900
weird procedure definition, in
terms of [? air ?], has the

1138
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,860
property that it satisfies this,
then you just have to

1139
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,520
grant me that that is a possible
implementation of

1140
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,030
cons, car, and cdr, on which I
can build everything else.

1141
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:50,980
Well, let's look at that.

1142
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,820
And this will be practice in
the substitution model.

1143
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:59,320


1144
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,690
How could we check this?

1145
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:01,840
We sort of know how
to do that.

1146
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,920
It's just the same substitution
model.

1147
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,310
Let's look.

1148
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,910
We start out, and we
say, what's car of

1149
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:11,120
cons of 37 and 49?

1150
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:11,720
What do we do?

1151
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,085
Cons is some procedure.

1152
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:15,950


1153
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:19,530
Its value is cons was a
procedure of a and b.

1154
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:25,450
The thing returned by cons is
its procedure body with 37 and

1155
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,370
49 substituted for
the parameters.

1156
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:32,770
It'll be 37 substituted for a
and 49 substituted for b.

1157
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:36,710
So this expression has the
same meaning as this

1158
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:37,170
expression.

1159
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:40,410
Its car of, and the body of
cons was this thing that

1160
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:43,190
started with lambda.

1161
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:46,730
And it says, so if pick is equal
to 1, where pick is this

1162
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,070
other argument, if pick is equal
to 1, it's 37, that's

1163
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:55,240
where a was, and if pick
is equal to 2, it's 49.

1164
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,410
So that's the first step.

1165
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,460
I'm just going through
mechanical substitution.

1166
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,630
And remember, at this point in
the course, if you're confused

1167
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,190
about what things mean, go
mechanically through the

1168
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,480
substitution model.

1169
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,920
Well, what is this reduced to?

1170
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:15,050
Car said, take your argument,
which in this case is this,

1171
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,060
and apply it to 1.

1172
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,979
That was the definition
of car.

1173
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:22,600
So if I look at car, if I do
that, the answer is, well,

1174
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,470
it's that argument, this
was the argument to

1175
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,319
car, applied to 1.

1176
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,580


1177
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,140
Well, what does that mean?

1178
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,800
I take 1, and I substitute it
in the body here for this

1179
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,630
value of pick, which
is the name of the

1180
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,779
argument, what do I get?

1181
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:43,390
Well, I get the thing that says
if 1 equals 1 it's 37,

1182
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,700
and if 1 equals 2 it's 49,
so the answer's 37.

1183
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,880
And similarly, if I'd taken cdr,
that would apply it to 2,

1184
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,729
and I'd get 49.

1185
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:55,020
So you see, what I've
demonstrated is that that

1186
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,560
completely weird implementation
of cons, car,

1187
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,000
and cdr, satisfies the axioms.
So it's a perfectly valid way

1188
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,100
of building, in fact, all of the
data objects we're going

1189
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,620
to see in Lisp.

1190
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,930
So they all, if you like,
can be built on sort of

1191
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:09,670
existential nothing.

1192
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:14,229
And as far as you know,
that's how it works.

1193
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:15,149
You couldn't tell.

1194
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:18,580
If all you're ever going to do
with pairs is construct them

1195
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,890
with cons and look at them with
car and cdr, you couldn't

1196
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:24,270
possibly tell how this
thing works.

1197
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,370
Now, it might give you a sort
of warm feeling inside if I

1198
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,470
say, well, yeah, in fact, for
various reasons there happens

1199
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:32,930
to be a primitive called cons,
car, and cdr, and if it's too

1200
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,330
scary, if this kind of stuff is
too scary, you don't have

1201
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,770
to look inside of it.

1202
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:40,060
So that might make you feel
better, but the point is, it

1203
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,910
really could work this way,
and it wouldn't make any

1204
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:46,590
difference to the
system at all.

1205
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,979
So in some sense, we don't
need data at all to build

1206
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:51,760
these data abstractions.

1207
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,860
We can do everything in
terms of procedures.

1208
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,500
OK, well, why did I terrify
you in this way?

1209
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,660
First, I really want to
reinforce this idea of

1210
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,670
abstraction, that you really
can do these things

1211
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:06,220
abstractly.

1212
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:10,640
Secondly, I want to introduce
an idea we're going to see

1213
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,190
more and more of in this course,
which is we're going

1214
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,440
to blur the line between
what's data

1215
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,715
and what's a procedure.

1216
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,350
See, in this funny
implementation it turned out

1217
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:26,340
that cons of something happened
to be represented in

1218
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:29,080
terms of a procedure, even
though we think of it as data.

1219
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,940


1220
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:35,360
While here that's sort of a
mathematical trick, but one of

1221
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,050
the things we'll see is that
a lot of the very important

1222
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:42,150
programming techniques that
we're going to get to sort of

1223
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:45,840
depend very crucially on
blurring this traditional line

1224
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,940
between what you consider
a procedure and what you

1225
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:48,950
consider data.

1226
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,060
We're going to see more
and more of that,

1227
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,495
especially next time.

1228
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:55,190
OK, questions?

1229
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,290
AUDIENCE: If you asked
the system to print

1230
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:00,720
a, what would happen?

1231
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,570
PROFESSOR: The question is, what
would happen if I asked

1232
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,600
the system to print a.

1233
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,200
Given this representation, you
already know the answer.

1234
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:16,360
The answer is compound
procedure a,

1235
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,485
just like last time.

1236
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:21,170


1237
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:22,590
It'd say compound procedure.

1238
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:25,150


1239
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,420
It might say a little
bit more.

1240
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,250
It might say compound procedure
lambda or something

1241
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,730
or other, depending on details
of how I named it.

1242
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:33,070
But it's a procedure.

1243
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:35,790
And the only reason for that is
I haven't told the system

1244
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:40,220
anything special about how
to print such things.

1245
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,500
Now, it's in fact true that with
the actual implementation

1246
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,630
of cons that to be built in
the system, it would print

1247
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:46,840
something else.

1248
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,890
It would print, say,
this is a pair.

1249
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:53,500


1250
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:58,870
AUDIENCE: When you define cons,
and then you pass it

1251
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:03,840
into values, how does it know
where to look for the cons,

1252
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,220
because you can use cons
over and over again?

1253
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:11,442
How does it know where to look
to know which a and b it's

1254
01:12:11,442 --> 01:12:13,500
supposed to pull back out?

1255
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,140
I don't know if I'm expressing
that quite right.

1256
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,120
Where is it stored?

1257
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:24,760
PROFESSOR: OK, the question is,
I sort of have a cons with

1258
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,880
a 37 and a 49, and I might make
another cons with a 1 and

1259
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,200
a 2, and I might have one
called a, and I might

1260
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,920
have one called b.

1261
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,400
And the question is,
how does it know?

1262
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,275
And why don't they
get confused?

1263
01:12:35,275 --> 01:12:37,510
And that's a very
good question.

1264
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,820


1265
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:43,280
See, you have to really believe
that the procedures

1266
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,550
are objects.

1267
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:46,725
It's sort of like saying--
let's try

1268
01:12:46,725 --> 01:12:49,340
another simpler example.

1269
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,190
Suppose I ask for the
square root of 3.

1270
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:55,760


1271
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,220
So I asked for the square root
of 5, and then I ask for the

1272
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:06,470
square of 20.

1273
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:09,050
You're probably not the least
bit bothered that I can take

1274
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,470
square root and apply it to 5,
and then I can take square

1275
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,880
root and apply it to 20.

1276
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,980
And there's sort of no issue,
gee, doesn't it get confused

1277
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,630
about whether it's working
on 5 or 20?

1278
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:23,120
There's no issue about that
because you're thinking of a

1279
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,600
procedure which goes off
and does something.

1280
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,410
Now, in some sense you're asking
me the same question.

1281
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,940
But it's really bothering you,
and it's bothering you for a

1282
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:34,140
really good reason.

1283
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,150
Because when I write that,
you're saying gee, this is, I

1284
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:38,300
know, sort of a procedure.

1285
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,250
But it's not a procedure
that's just running.

1286
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,600
It's just sort of a procedure
sitting there.

1287
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,570
And how can it be that sometimes
this procedure has

1288
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:49,540
37 and 49, and there might be
another one which has 5 and 6

1289
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:52,630
in there, and why don't
they get confused?

1290
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:55,910
So there's something very,
very important that's

1291
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,990
bothering you.

1292
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:01,380
And it's really crucial
to what's going on.

1293
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:05,870
We're suddenly saying that
procedures are not just the

1294
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,290
act of doing something.

1295
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:12,310
Procedures are conceptual
entities, objects, and if I

1296
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,080
built cons of 37 and 49, that's
a particular procedure

1297
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,070
that sits there.

1298
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:21,490
And it's different from
cons of 3 and 4.

1299
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,020
That's another procedure
that sits there.

1300
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,060
AUDIENCE: Both of them
exist independently.

1301
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,610
PROFESSOR: And exists
independently.

1302
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,370
AUDIENCE: And they both can be
referenced by car and cdr.

1303
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,350
PROFESSOR: And they both would
be referenced by car and cdr.

1304
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:35,500
Just like I could increment
this, and I

1305
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,270
could increment that.

1306
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,960
They're objects.

1307
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,730
And that's sort of where
we're going.

1308
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:43,660
See, the fact that you're asking
the question shows that

1309
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:46,330
you're really starting to think
about the implications

1310
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,790
of what's going on.

1311
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:50,820
It's the difference between
saying a procedure is just the

1312
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,070
act of doing something.

1313
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:56,270
And a procedure is a real object
that has existence.

1314
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:58,550
AUDIENCE: So when the procedure
gets built, the

1315
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:01,930
actual values are now
substituted for a and b--

1316
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,050
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1317
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:04,870
AUDIENCE: And then that
procedure exists as lambda,

1318
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:07,720
and pick is what's actually
passed in.

1319
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:11,850
PROFESSOR: Yes, when cons gets
called, and the result of cons

1320
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:14,260
is a new procedure that's
constructed, that new

1321
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,440
procedure has an argument
that's called pick.

1322
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,830
AUDIENCE: But it no longer
has an a and b.

1323
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:20,416
The a and b are the
actual values

1324
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:20,820
that are passed through.

1325
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,280
PROFESSOR: And it has-- right,
according to the substitution

1326
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,340
model, what it now has is not
those arbitrary names a and b,

1327
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:31,560
it somehow has that 37
and 49 in there.

1328
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,520
But you're right, that's a hard
thing to think about it,

1329
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,150
and it's different from the way
you've been thinking about

1330
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,500
procedures.

1331
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,285
AUDIENCE: And if I have again
cons of 37 and 49, it's a

1332
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,300
different [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

1333
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:51,790
PROFESSOR: And if you make
another cons of 37 and 49,

1334
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,390
you're into a wonderful
philosophical problem, which

1335
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:57,870
is going to be what the lecture
about halfway through

1336
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:00,080
this course is about.

1337
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,810
Which is, if I cons 37 and 49,
and I do it again, is that the

1338
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:06,490
same thing, or is it
a different thing?

1339
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,680
And how could you tell?

1340
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,240
And when could it
possibly matter?

1341
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:18,110
And that's sort of like
saying, is that the

1342
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:21,140
same thing as this?

1343
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,850
Or is this the same
thing as that?

1344
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,150
It's the same kind
of question.

1345
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,930
And that's a very, very
deep question.

1346
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:30,180
And I can't answer in
less than an hour.

1347
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,770
But we will.

1348
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:45,972
