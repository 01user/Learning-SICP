符号化求导系统

教授：哈尔教授讲解了如何构造健壮的系统
PROFESSOR: Well, Hal just told us how you build robust systems.

关键点就是
The key idea was--

我确信你们大多数人到现在为止还不太明白
I'm sure that many of you don't really assimilate that yet--

关键点就是 为了让系统具有健壮性
but the key idea is that in order to make a system that's robust, 

应该让它对小变化不敏感
it has to be insensitive to small changes,

也就是说
that is,

问题中的小改变只会导致解决方案的小改动
a small change in the problem should lead to only a small change in the solution.

系统应该是连续的
There ought to be a continuity.

解决方案应该的问题的一个延续
The space of solutions ought to be continuous in this space of problems.

Hal教授给你们解释过
The way he was explaining how to do that


was instead of solving a particular problem

at every level of decomposition of the problem at the subproblems,


where you solve the class of problems,


which are a neighborhood of the particular problem that you're trying to solve.

解决之道便是在该层构造一门语言
The way you do that is by producing a language at that level of detail

使得我们可以用这门语言来表述这类问题
in which the solutions to that class of problems is representable in that language.

因此 当着手解决的问题再发生变动时
Therefore when you makes more changes to the problem you're trying to solve,

通常 你只需要在已构造好的解决方案上做出微小改动
you generally have to make only small local changes to the solution you've constructed,

因为在你所处层面上
because at the level of detail you're working,

有一门语言可以
there's a language where you can express 

表达与该问题类似的其它问题的各种解法
the various solutions to alternate problems of the same type.

呃... 这是一个重要思想的萌芽
Well that's the beginning of a very important idea,

其重要性也使得计算机科学比
the most important perhaps idea that makes computer science more powerful

大多数其它工程学科还要强大
than most of the other kinds of engineering disciplines we know about.

目前为止 我们学习的是
What we've seen so far

类似于如何使用语言内置元素
is sort of how to use embedding of languages.

当然 内置元素的力量一部分来源于过程
And, of course, the power of embedding languages partly comes from

就比如这个 我昨天给你们展示过了
procedures like this one that I showed you yesterday.

这里 是一份昨天给你们描述过的求导程序
What you see here is the derivative program that we described yesterday.

这个过程以一个过程为参数
It's a procedure that takes a procedure as an argument

并返回一个过程
and returns a procedure as a value.

这个系统很棒
And using such things is very nice.

你可以压入组合子 #TBD
You can make things like push combinators

还有你上次看到的各种美妙的事
and all that sort of wonderful thing that you saw last time.

然而 现在我要搅浑这滩水
However, now I'm going to really muddy the waters.

这个程序混淆了过程和数据
See this confuses the issue of what's the procedure and what is data,

虽然不太严重
but not very badly.

而我们将要严重地混淆两者
What we really want to do is confuse it very badly.

最好的做法就是
And the best way to do that


is to get involved with the manipulation of the algebraic expressions that the procedures themselves are expressed in.
￼
所以 这里我不会讨论这张幻灯片上的东西
So at this point, I want to talk about instead of things like on this slide,

一个通过操作过程的求导程序
the derivative procedure being a thing that manipulates a procedure--

这只是一个数值方法而已
this is a numerical method you see here.

你们所看到的是 用数值近似的方法来呈现的求导
And what you're seeing is a representation of the numerical approximationto the derivative.

也就是这里的东西了
That's what's here.

事实上 我想讨论的是这些东西
In fact what I'd like to talk about is instead things that look like this.

这是一份从微积分书中摘录的法则
And what we have here are rules from a calculus book.

这是求导函数表达式的法则
These are rules for finding the derivatives of the expressions

不过是用代数语言书写的
that one might write in some algebraic language.

法则说 常数的导数是0
It says things like a derivative of a constant is 0.

而代表你所讨论的那个数的导数为1
The derivative of the valuable with respect to which you are taking the derivative is 1.

常数乘以函数的导数
The derivative of a constant times the function

其值是常数的值乘以函数导数的值
is the constant times the derivative of the function,

就是这个意思
and things like that.

这些都是精确的表达式 而非数值近似
These are exact expressions. These are not numerical approximations.

我们还能编写程序吗？
Can we make programs?

事实上 编写处理这些表达式的程序非常容易
And, in fact, it's very easy to make programs that manipulate these expressions.

让我们来仔细地看看这些法则
Well let's see. Let's look at these rules in some detail.

你们曾经在初等微积分课上学过这些法则了
You all have seen these rules in your elementary calculus class at one time or another.

微积分中
And you know from calculus

对多元表达式求导很容易
that it's easy to produce derivatives of arbitrary expressions.

在微积分课上 你们也知道计算积分不容易
You also know from your elementary calculus that it's hard to produce integrals. 

虽然积分和求导相对
Yet integrals and derivatives are opposites of each other.

它俩互为逆运算
They're inverse operations.

但它们有同样地法则
And they have the same rules.

但这些法则中又有什么特殊的东西
What is special about these rules that makes it possible for one

使得求导容易 求积分就困难呢？
to produce derivatives easily and integrals why it's so hard?

我们浅显地想一想
Let's think about that very simply.

仔细考察这些法则
Look at these rules.

对于每条法则来说 你求导数时的方向
Every one of these rules, when used in the direction for taking derivatives,

这个箭头的方向
which is in the direction of this arrow,

法则的左边与你的表达式相匹配
the left side is matched against your expression,

法则的右边就是表达式的导数
and the right side is the thing which is the derivative of that expression.

箭头是这个方向的
The arrow is going that way.

每条法则中
In each of these rules,

法则右边的表达式
the expressions on the right-hand side of the rule

都是求导过程中的子表达式
that are contained within derivatives are subexpressions,

都是左边式子的合法的子表达式 #TBD
are proper subexpressions, of the expression on the left-hand side.

这里 我们发现 和的导数
So here we see the derivative of the sum,

也就是左边式子的导数
witch is the expression on the left-hand side

就是两部分之和
is the sum of the derivatives of the pieces.

法则从左至右的方向是“归约式规则”
So the rule of moving to the right are reduction rules.

问题就变简单了
The problem becomes easier.

我把一个复杂的问题 转化成了许多小点儿的问题
I turn a big complicated problem it's lots of smaller problems

然后把结果组合起来 用递归的方法完美地解决了
and then combine the results, a perfect place for recursion to work.

但如果我从另外的方向来思考
If I'm going in the other direction like this,

如果我想求积分的话 你会发现有很多问题
if I'm trying to produce integrals, well there are several problems you see here. 

就比如 如果我想求一个和的积分
First of all, if I try to integrate an expression like a sum,

就会有多条法则符合
more than one rule matches.

这条符合
Here's one that matches.

这条也符合
Here's one that matches.

我不知道该用哪个——它们之间可能不一样
I don't know which one to take. And they may be different.

我得考察两者的不同之处
I may get to explore different things.

所以 在这个方向上 表达式变复杂了
Also, the expressions become larger in that direction.

当表达式变复杂时
And when the expressions become larger,

就没法保证我所选的路径一定能终止了
then there's no guarantee that any particular path I choose will terminate,

因为唯一的可能是偶然的约分
because we will only terminate by accidental cancellation.

这也就是为什么 积分是一种复杂的搜索 而难以完成
So that's why integrals are complicated searches and hard to do.

现在我不想处理这么复杂的东西
Right now I don't want to do anything as hard as that.

我们先来讨论求导数
Let's work on derivatives for a while.

好吧 我就假设你们都了解这些法则了
Well, these rules are ones you know for the most part hopefully.

让我们来看看能不能用程序表达这些法则
So let's see if we can write a program which is these rules.

这应该很容易
And that should be very easy.

信手拈来
Just write the program.

因为 我给你们展示的是“归约式规则”
See, because while I showed you is that it's a reduction rule,

这样用递归来编写会比较合适
it's something appropriate for a recursion.

当然 对每条法则来说就是一种情况
And, of course, what we have for each of these rules is we have a case

我们做“分情况分析”
in some case analysis.

我就这么写了
So I'm just going to write this program down.

当然 我得先让你们认识到点什么 对吧？
Now, of course, I'm going to be saying something you have to believe. Right?

我希望你们认识到我可以表示这些代数式
What you have to believe is I can represent these algebraic expressions,

我可以从中抽取式子 也可以将它们组合起来
that I can grab their parts, that I can put them together.

我们发明了表结构来解决这个问题
We've invented list structures so that you can do that.

但现在我们不必关心
But you don't want to worry about that now.

现在 我要编写一个程序来封装这些法则
Right now I'm going to write the program that encapsulates these rules

使它独立于代数表达式的表示法
independent of the representation of the algebraic expressions.

(DERIV EXP VAR)表示表达式EXP对于变量VAR的导数
You have a derivative of an expression with respect to a variable.

这和函数的导数是不一样的
This is a different thing than the derivative of the function.

那个是我们上节课看到的数值近似
That's what we saw last time, that numerical approximation.

这是由于你无法看到函数内部
It's something you can't open up a function.

这只是一个数值
It's just the answers.

表达式的导数与它的书写别无二致
The derivative of an expression is the way it's written.

因此 这只是一个语法问题
And therefore it's a syntactic phenomenon.

我们今天要做的大多数工作 就是讨论语法
And so a lot of what we're going to be doing today is worrying about syntax,

表达式的语法或类似
syntax of expressions and things like that.

这有一个CASE语句
Well, there's a case analysis.

任何时候我们处理复杂事物都是通过递归
Anytime we do anything complicated thereby a recursion,

我们很可能需要“按情况分析”
we presumably need a case analysis.

通常都是这样开始的
It's the essential way to begin.

大一点的问题都是用“按情况分析” #TBD
And that's usually a conditional of some large kind.

那么 有哪些可能（的情况）呢？
Well, what are their possibilities?

第一条法则说 如果你遇到一个常数
the first rule that you saw is this something a constant?

这里 我就是在判断
And what I'm asking is,

表达式EXP是否是关于给定变量VAR的常数
is the expression a constant with respect to the variable given?

如果是的话 结果就是0
If so, the result is 0,

因为导数表征的是某物的变化率
because the derivative represents the rate of change of something.

然而
If, however,

如果我求导的表达式 与我关心的变量有关
the expression that I'm taking the derivative of is the variable I'm varying,

如果判定表达式和变量相同
then this is the same variable, the expression var,

那么关于变量VAR的表达式EXP的变化率就是1
then the rate of change of the expression with respect to the variable is 1.

它俩相同 结果是1
It's the same 1.

当然 还可能有其它的可能性
Well now there are a couple of other possibilities.

比如说 它可能是一个和式
It could, for example, be a sum.

呃 我现在还完全知道该如何表示和式
Well, I don't know how I'm going to express sums yet.

事实上 我可以
Actually I do.

只是我还没有告诉你们
But I haven't told you yet.

如果表达式是一个和式
But is it a sum?

我就假想有一种方式可以判别（和式）
I'm imagining that there's some way of telling.

我将在这里做一个表达式的类型分配
I'm doing a dispatch on the type of the expression here,

这是在构建语言时绝对必要的
absolutely essential in building languages.

语言由不同的表达式构成
Languages are made out of different expressions.

不就我们就将看到
And soon we're going to see that

如何用更强大的方法 用语言去构建语言
in our more powerful methods of building languages on languages.

表达式是和式吗？
Is an expression a sum?

如果是的话 很好 我们已经知道和式的求导法则了
If it's a sum, well, we know the rule for derivative of the sum

即是各部分导数之和
is the sum of the derivatives of the parts.

其中一个叫做加数 另一个叫做被加数
One of them is called the addend and the other is the augend.

黑板上没那么多空间写这么长的名字了
But I don't have enough space on the blackboard to such long names.

我就姑且把它们叫做 A1和A2
So I'll call them A1 and A2.

将它们求和
I want to make a sum.

10 ：01
Do you remember which is the sum for end or the menu end?


Or was it the dividend and the divisor or something like that?

将A1的导数...
Make sum of the derivative of the A1, I'll call it.

这是关于VAR的表达式的加数
It's the addend of the expression with respect to the variable,

与A2的导数相加
and the derivative of the A2 of the expression,


because the two arguments, the addition with respect to the variable.

我们知道还有一条乘法的求导法则
And another rule that we know is product rule,

也就是说 如果表达式是积式
which is, if the expression is a product.

顺便说下 当你定义过程时 有个好习惯
By the way, it's a good idea when you're defining things,

就是在定义谓词时
when you're defining predicates,

将谓词名以问号结尾
to give them a name that ends in a question mark.

问号本身不代表什么
This question mark doesn't mean anything.

但这是俗成的约定
It's for us as an agreement.

这是人们之间约定的接口 以方便他人阅读你的脚本
It's a conventional interface between humans so you can read my programs more easily.

我希望你在写程序的时候
So I want you to, when you write programs,

当你定义谓词的时候
if you define a predicate procedure,

就是那些返回TRUE或FALSE的过程
that's something that returns true of false,

你应该使它们的名字以问号结尾
it should have a name which ends in question mark.

这对Lisp无异 但对人类友好
The lisp doesn't care. I care.

我需要求和
I want to make a sum.

因为积的导数就是...
Because the derivative of a product is the sum

被乘数乘以乘数的导数
of the first times the derivative of the second plus

加上乘数乘以被乘数的导数
the second times the derivative of the first.

两者加起来
Make a sum of two things,

求积... 呃 就用表达式中的M1来表示（被乘数）好了
a product of, well, I'm going to say the M1 of the expression,

表达式中M2关于变量VAR的导数
and the derivative of the M2 of the expression with respect to the variable,

以及 M1的导数乘以
and the product of the derivative of M1,

M1是这里的被乘数
the multiplier of the expression, with respect to the variable.

12:17
It's the product of that and the multiplicand, M2, of the expression.

Make that product. Make the sum. Close that case.

And, of course, I could add as many cases as I like here

for a complete set of rules you might find in a calculus book.

So this is what it takes to encapsulate those rules.

And you see, you have to realize there's a lot of wishful thinking here.

I haven't told you anything about how I'm going to make these representations.

Now, once I've decided that this is my set of rules,

I think it's time to play with the representation.

Let's attack that.

Well, first of all, I'm going to play a pun.

It's an important pun.

It's a key to a sort of powerful idea.

If I want to represent sums, and products, and differences, and quotients,

and things like that,

why not use the same language as I'm writing my program in?

I write my program in algebraic expressions that look like

the sum of the product on a and the product of x and x,

and things like that.

And the product of b and x and c, whatever, 

make that a sum of the product.

Right now I don't want to have procedures with unknown numbers of arguments,

a product of b and x and c.

This is list structure.

And the reason why this is nice,

is because any one of these objects has a property.

I know where the car is.

The car is the operator.

And the operands are the successive cdrs

the successive cars of the cdrs of the list that this is.

It makes it very convenient.

I have to parse it. It's been done for me.

I'm using the embedding and Lisp to advantage.

So, for example,

let's start using list structure to write down the representation

that I'm implicitly assuming here.

Well I have to define various things that are implied in this representation.

Like I have to find out how to do a constant,

how you do same variable.

Let's do those first. That's pretty easy enough.

Now I'm going to be introducing lots of primitives here,

because these are the primitives that come with list structure.

OK, you define a constant.

And what I mean by a constant,

an expression that's constant with respect to a veritable,

is that the expression is something simple.

I can't take it into pieces,

and yet it isn't that variable.

I can't break it up, and yet it isn't that variable.

That does not mean that there may be other expressions

that are more complicated that are constants.

It's just that I'm going to look at the primitive constants in this way.

So what this is, is it says that's it's the and.

I can combine predicate expressions which return true or false with and.

Something atomic, The expression is atomic,

meaning it cannot be broken into parts.

It doesn't have a car and a cdr.

It's not a list.

It adds a special test built into the system.

And it's not identically equal to that variable.

I'm representing my variables by things that are symbols which cannot be broken into pieces,

things like x, and y, things like this.

Whereas, of course, something like this can be broken up into pieces.

And the same variable of an expression with respect to a variable is,

in fact, an atomic expression.

I want to have an atomic expression, which is identical.

I don't want to look inside this stuff anymore.

These are primitive maybe.

But it doesn't matter.

I'm using things that are given to me with a language.

I'm not terribly interest in them.

Now how do we deal with sums?

Ah, something very interesting will happen.

A sum is something which is not atomic and begins with the plus symbol.

That's what it means.

So here, I will define.

An question is a sum if and it's not atomic

and it's head, it's beginning,

its car of the expression is the symbol plus.

Now you're about to see something you haven't seen before, this quotation.


Why do I have that quotation there?

说你的名字
Say your name,

观众：Susanna
AUDIENCE: Susanna.

教授：大点声儿
PROFESSOR: Louder.

观众：Susanna
AUDIENCE: Susanna

教授：说“你的名字”
PROFESSOR: Say your name.

观众：“你的名字”
AUDIENCE: Your name.

教授：大点声儿
PROFESSOR: Louder.

观众：“你的名字”
AUDIENCE: Your name.

教授：对了
PROFESSOR: OK.

What I'm showing you here is that the words of English are ambiguous.

I was saying, say your name.

I was also possibly saying say, your name.

But that cannot be distinguished in speech.

However, we do have a notation in writing,

which is quotation for distinguishing these two possible meanings.

In particular, over here,

in Lisp we have a notation for distinguishing these meanings.

If I were to just write a plus here, a plus symbol,

I would be asking, is the first element of the expression,

is the operator position of the expression, the addition operator?

I don't know.

I would have to have written the addition operator there,

which I can't write.

However, this way I'm asking, is this the symbolic object plus,

which normally stands for the addition operator?

That's what I want. That's the question I want to ask.

Now before I go any further,

I want to point out the quotation is a very complex concept,

and adding it to a language causes a great deal of troubles.

Consider the next slide. 

Here's a deduction which we should all agree with.

We have, Alyssa is smart and Alyssa is George's mother.

This is an equality, is.

From those two, we can deduce that George's mother is smart.

Because we can always substitute equals for equals in expressions.

真是这样吗？
Or can we?

Here's a case where we have "Chicago" has seven letters.

The quotation means that I'm discussing the word Chicago,

not what the word represents.

Here I have that Chicago is the biggest city in Illinois.

As a consequence of this,

I would like to deduce that the biggest city in Illinois has seven letters.

But that's manifestly false.

Wow, it works.

OK, so once we have things like that,

our language gets much more complicated.

Because it's no longer true that things we tend to like to do with languages,

like substituting equals for equals and getting right answers,

are going to work without being very careful.

We can't substitute into what's called referentially opaque contexts,

of which a quotation is the prototypical type of referentially opaque context.

If you know what that means, you can consult a philosopher.

Presumably there is one in the room.

In any case, let's continue now,

now that we at least have an operational understanding of a 2000-year-old issue

that has to do with name, and mention, and all sorts of things like that.

I have to define what I mean, how to make a sum of two things, an a1 and a2.

And I'm going to do this very simply.

It's a list of the symbol plus, and a1, and a2.

And I can determine the first element.

Define a1 to be cadr.

I've just introduced another primitive.

This is the car of the cdr of something.

You might want to know why car and cdr are names of these primitives,

and why they've survived, even though they're much better ideas like left and right.

We could have called them things like that.

Well, first of all, the names come from the fact that in the great past,

when Lisp was invented,

I suppose in '58 or something, it was on a 704 or something like that,

which had a machine. It was a machine that had an address register and a decrement register.

And these were the contents of the address register and the decrement register.

So it's an historical accident.

Now why have these names survived?

It's because Lisp programmers like to talk to each other over the phone.

And if you want to have a long sequence of cars and cdrs you might say, cdaddedr,

which can be understood.

But left of right or right of left is not so clear if you get good at it.

So that's why we have these words.

All of them up to four deep are defined typically in a Lisp system.

A2 to be-- and, of course, you can see that if I looked at one of these expressions

like the sum of 3 and 5,

what that is is a list containing the symbol plus, and a number 3, and a number 5.

Then the car is the symbol plus.

The car of the cdr.

Well I take the cdr and then I take the car.

And that's how I get to the 3. That's the first argument.

And the car of the cdr of the cdr gets me to this one, the 5.

And similarly, of course, I can define what's going on with products.

Let's do that very quickly.

Is the expression a product?

Yes if and if it's true, that's it's not atomic

and it's EQ quote, the asterisk symbol, which is the operator for multiplication.

Make product of an M1 and an M2 to be list,

quote, the asterisk operation and M1 and M2.

And I define M1 to be cadr and M2 to be caddr.

You get to be a good Lisp programmer because you start talking that way.

I cdr down lists and console them up and so on.

Now, now that we have essentially a complete program for finding derivatives,

you can add more rules if you like.

What kind of behavior do we get out of it?

I'll have to clear that x.

Well, supposing I define foo here

to be the sum of the product of ax square and bx plus c.

That's the same thing we see here

as the algebraic expression written in the more conventional notation over there.

Well, the derivative of foo with respect to x, which we can see over here,

is this horrible, horrendous mess.

I would like it to be 2ax plus b.

But it's not. It's equivalent to it.

What is it?

I have here, what do I have?

I have the derivative of the product of x and x.

Over here is, of course, the sum of x times 1 and 1 times x.

Now, well, it's the first times the derivative of the second plus the second times the derivative of the first.

It's right.

That's 2x of course. a times 2x is 2ax plus 0X square doesn't count plus B over here plus a bunch of 0's.

Well the answer is right.

But I give people take off points on an exam for that, sadly enough.

Let's worry about that in the next segment.

Are there any questions?

Yes?

AUDIENCE: If you had left the quote when you put the plus,

then would that be referring to the procedure plus

and could you do a comparison between that procedure and some other procedure if you wanted to?

PROFESSOR: Yes. Good question.

If I had left this quotation off at this point,

if I had left that quotation off at that point,

then I would be referring here to the procedure which is the thing that plus is defined to be.

And indeed, I could compare some procedures with each other for identity.

Now what that means is not clear right now.

I don't like to think about it.

Because I don't know exactly what it would need to compare procedures.

There are reasons why that may make no sense at all.

However, the symbols, we understand.

And so that's why I put that quote in.

I want to talk about the symbol that's apparent on the page.

Any other questions?

OK. Thank you. Let's take a break.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

We've just developed a fairly plausible program for computing the derivatives of algebraic expressions.

It's an incomplete program, if you would like to add more rules.

And perhaps you might extend it to deal with uses of addition with any number of arguments and multiplication with any of the number of arguments.

And that's all rather easy.

However, there was a little fly in that ointment.

We go back to this slide.

We see that the expressions that we get are rather bad.

This is a rather bad expression.

How do we get such an expression?

Why do we have that expression?

Let's look at this expression in some detail.

Let's find out where all the pieces come from.

As we see here, we have a sum--

just what I showed you at the end of the last time--

of X times 1 plus 1 time X.

That is a derivative of this product.

The produce of a times that, where a does not depend upon x,

and therefore is constant with respect to x,

is this sum, which goes from here all the way through here and through here.

Because it is the first thing times the derivative of the second

plus the derivative of the first times the second

as the program we wrote on the blackboard indicated we should do.

And, of course, the product of bx over here

manifests itself as B times 1 plus 0 times X

because we see that B does not depend upon X.

And so the derivative of B is this 0,

and the derivative of X with respect itself is the 1.

And, of course, the derivative of the sums over here turn into these two sums of the derivatives of the parts.

So what we're seeing here is exactly the thing

I was trying to tell you about with Fibonacci numbers a while ago,

that the form of the process

is expanded from the local rules that you see in the procedure,

that the procedure represents a set of local rules for the expansion of this process.

And here, the process left behind some stuff, which is the answer.

And it was constructed by the walk it takes of the tree structure,

which is the expression.

So every part in the answer we see here derives from some part of the problem.

Now, we can look at, for example, the derivative of foo,

which is ax square plus bx plus c,

with respect to other things, like here, for example,

we can see that the derivative of foo with respect to a.

And it's very similar. It's, in fact, the identical algebraic expression,

except for the fact that theses 0's and 1's are in different places.

Because the only degree of freedom we have in this tree walk

is what's constant with respect to the variable we're taking the derivative with respect to

and was the same variable.

In other words, if we go back to this blackboard and we look,

we have no choice what to do when we take the derivative of the sum or a product.

The only interesting place here is, is the expression the variable,

or is the expression a constant with respect to that variable

for very, very small expressions?

In which case we get various 1's and 0's, which if we go back to this slide,

we can see that the 0's that appear here, for example,

this 1 over here in derivative of foo with respect to A,

which gets us an X square,

because that 1 gets the multiply of X and X into the answer, that 1 is 0.

Over here, we're not taking the derivative of foo with respect to c.

But the shapes of these expressions are the same.

See all those shapes. They're the same.

Well is there anything wrong with our rules?

No. They're the right rules.

We've been through this one before.

One of the things you're going to begin to discover

is that there aren't too many good ideas.

When we were looking at rational numbers yesterday,

the problem was that we got 6/8 rather then 3/4.

The answer was unsimplified.

The problem, of course, is very similar.

There are things I'd like to be identical by simplification that don't become identical.

And yet the rules for doing addition a multiplication of rational numbers were correct.

So the way we might solve this problem is do the thing we did last time, which always works.

If something worked last time it ought to work again.

It's changed representation.

Perhaps in the representation we could put in a simplification step

that produces a simplified representation.

This may not always work, of course.

I'm not trying to say that it always works.

But it's one of the pieces of artillery we have in our war against complexity.

You see, because we solved our problem very carefully.

What we've done, is we've divided the world in several parts.

There are derivatives rules and general rules for algebra of some sort at this level of detail.

and i have an abstraction barrier.

And i have the representation of the algebraic expressions, list structure.

And in this barrier, I have the interface procedures.

I have constant, and things like same-var.

I have things like sum, make-sum.

I have A1, A2.

I have products and things like that,

all the other things I might need for various kinds of algebraic expressions.

Making this barrier allows me to arbitrarily change the representation

without changing the rules that are written in terms of that representation.

So if I can make the problem go away by changing representation,

the composition of the problem into these two parts has helped me a great deal.

So let's take a very simple case of this.

What was one of the problems?

Let's go back to this transparency again.

And we see here, oh yes, there's horrible things

like here is the sum of an expression and 0.

Well that's no reason to think of it as anything other than the expression itself.

Why should the summation operation have made up this edition?

It can be smarter than that.

Or here, for example, is a multiplication of something by 1.

It's another thing like that.

Or here is a product of something with 0, which is certainly 0.

So we won't have to make this construction.

So why don't we just do that?

We need to change the way the representation works, almost here.

Make-sum to be.

Well, now it's not something so simple.

I'm not going to make a list containing the symbol plus and things unless I need to.

Well, what are the possibilities?

If...I have some sort of cases here.

If I have numbers, if a1 is a number--

and here's another primitive I've just introduced,

it's possible to tell whether something's number--

and if number A2, meaning they're not symbolic expressions,

then why not do the addition now?

The result is just a plus of A1 and A2.

I'm not asking if these represent numbers.

Of course all of these symbols represent numbers.

I'm talking about whether the one I've got is the number 3 right now.

And, for example,

supposing A1 is a number, and it's equal to 0,

well then the answer is just A2.

There is no reason to make anything up.

And if A2 is a number, and equal A2 0,

then the result is A1.

And only if I can't figure out something better to do with this situation,

well, I can start a list.

Otherwise I want the representation to be the list

containing the quoted symbol plus, and A1, and A2.

And, of course, a very similar thing can be done for products.

And I think I'll avoid boring you with them.

I was going to write it on the blackboard.

I don't think it's necessary. You know what to do.

It's very simple.

But now, let's just see the kind of results we get out of changing our program in this way.

Well, here's the derivatives after having just changed the constructors for expressions.

The same foo, aX square plus bX plus c,

and what I get is nothing more than the derivative of that is 2aX plus B.

Well, it's not completely simplified.

I would like to collect common terms and sums.

Well, that's more work.

And, of course, programs to do this sort of thing are huge and complicated.

Algebraic simplification, it's a very complicated mess.

There's a very famous program you may have heard of called Maxima developed at MIT in the past,

which is 5,000 pages of Lisp code,

mostly the algebraic simplification operations.

There we see the derivative of foo.

In fact, X is at something I wouldn't take off more than 1 point for on an elementary calculus class.

And the derivative of foo with respect to a, well it's gone down to X times X, 

which isn't so bad.

And the derivative of foo with respect to b is just X itself.

And the derivative of foo with respect to c comes out 1.

So I'm pretty pleased with this.

What you've seen is, of course, a little bit contrived, carefully organized example

to show you how we can manipulate algebraic expressions,

how we do that abstractly in terms of abstract syntax

rather than concrete syntax and how we can use the abstraction to control what goes on in building these expressions.

But the real story isn't just such a simple thing as that.

The real story is, in fact, that I'm manipulating these expressions.

And the expressions are the same expressions--

going back to the slide--

as the ones that are Lisp expressions.

There's a pun here.

I've chosen my representation to be the same as the representation in my language of similar things.

By doing so, I've invoked a necessity.

I created the necessity to have things like quotation

because of the fact that my language is capable of writing expressions that talk about expressions of the language.

I need to have something that says, this is an expression I'm talking about

rather than this expression is talking about something,

and I want to talk about that.

So quotation stops and says, I'm talking about this expression itself.

Now, given that power,

if I can manipulate expressions of the language,

I can begin to build even much more powerful layers upon layers of languages.

Because I can write languages that not only are embedded in Lisp

or whatever language you start with,

but languages that are completely different,

that are just, if we say, interpreted in Lisp or something like that.

We'll get to understand those words more in the future.

But right now I just want to leave you with the fact that we've hit a line

which gives us tremendous power.

And this point we've bought a sledgehammer.

We have to be careful to what flies when we apply it.

Thank you.
