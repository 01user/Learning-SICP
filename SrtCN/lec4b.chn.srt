[音乐]
[MUSIC-- "JESU, JOY OF
MAN'S DESIRING" BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH]

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,840
教授：到目前为止 我们已经进行了很多
PROFESSOR: So far in this course we've been talking

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,780
关于数据抽象的讨论
a lot about data abstraction.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,152
关键理念就是在构造系统的时候
And remember the idea is that we build systems

5
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:32,560
在其中加入水平的抽象屏障 这些抽象屏障
that have these horizontal barriers in them, these abstraction barriers

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,216
把你使用一个数据对象的方式
that separate use, the way you might use some data object,

7
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,180
和表示它的方式区分开来
from the way you might represent it.

8
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,032
或者可以这样理解它 在上层有一个老板
Or another way to think of that is up here you have the boss

9
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:55,504
想要调用某种数据对象
who's going to be using some sort of data object.

10
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,310
而在下层 George负责它的具体实现
And down here is George who's implemented it.

11
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,424
这种把使用与表示分离的想法
Now this notion of separating use from representation

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,760
可以让你分开考虑这两个问题
so you can think about these two problems separately

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,768
这是一种非常强大的编程的方法论 -- 数据抽象
is a very,very powerful programming methodology, data abstraction.

14
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,816
但另一方面 数据抽象在那些真正复杂的系统上
On the other hand, it's not really sufficient

15
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:28,640
并不是很有效 这个问题就出在George这里
for really complex systems. And the problem with this is George.

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,090
或者 实际上 问题就在于
Or actually, the problem is that

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,784
现在有太多的George
there are a lot of Georges.

18
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,390
具体地说
Let's be concrete.

19
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,184
假设现在有George和Martha两个人
Let's suppose there is George,and there's also Martha.

20
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,224
他们都是这个系统的开发人员
OK, now George and Martha are both working on this system,

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,296
都在设计数据的表示方法
both designing representations,

22
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,672
而且他们完全合不来
and absolutely are incompatible.

23
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,620
他们不会合作开发同一种表示方法
They wouldn't cooperate on a representation

24
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:55,344
永远也不会
under any circumstances.

25
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:59,728
现在的问题是 假设你想要这样一个系统
And the problem is you would like to have some system

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,608
在这个系统中George和Martha都为它设计了数据表示方法
where both George and Martha are designing representations,

27
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:08,080
但是如果你在高于这个抽象屏障的层面思考
and, yet, if you're above this abstraction barrier

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,040
你就不用去操心这些事情
you don't want to have to worry about that,

29
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,180
不用操心 某个东西是到底是George做的还是Martha做的
whether something is done by George or by Martha.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,430
同时你也不想让George和Martha
And you don't want George and Martha to

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,480
妨碍彼此的工作
interfere with each other.

32
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,310
你在设计系统的时候 不仅仅需要这些
Somehow in designing a system, you not only want these

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,216
水平的抽象屏障 同时也想设置一道
horizontal barriers, but you also want some kind of

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,980
垂直的屏障 -- 来把George和Martha分离开
some kind of vertical barrier to keep George and Martha separate.

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,408
我们来说得再具体一点
Let me be a little bit more concrete.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,544
想象一个很大的公司的人事记录
Imagine that you're thinking about personnel records

37
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:46,112
这个公司里有很多部门没什么联系
for a large company with a lot of loosely linked divisions

38
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:49,712
并且部门之间合作得也不太好
that don't cooperate very well either.

39
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,040
甚至还可以想象这个大公司就是由
And imagine even that this company is formed by merging a

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,450
很多公司组成的 而且每个公司
whole bunch of companies that already have their personnel

41
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,700
都有自己的一套人事记录
record system set up.

42
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,570
想象一下突然有一天 这些部门
And imagine that once these divisions are all linked in

43
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,530
被一种神奇的卫星网络连接起来
some kind of very sophisticated satellite

44
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,528
它们各自的数据库都被放到了一起
network, and all these databases are put together.

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,856
现在你想要
And what you'd like to do

46
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:16,336
在公司的任何地方
is from any place in the company,

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,130
都能够知道 哦 某一条人事记录里的
to be able to say things like,oh, what's the name in a

48
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,872
“姓名”是什么
personnel record?

49
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,152
或者一条记录里的“工作”是什么
Or, what's the job description in a personnel record?

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,400
同时又不需要担心每一个部门
And not have to worry about the fact that each division

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,760
对于人事记录的格式
obviously is going to have completely separate

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,376
有着完全不同的习惯
conventions for how you might implement these records.

53
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,264
从你的视角上你不想去了解这些东西
From this point you don't want to know about that.

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,920
那么怎么才能做到这样呢？
Well how could you possibly do that?

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,416
当然 一种方法是下发一个告示
One way, of course, is to send down an edict from somewhere

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,290
来通知所有人把他们的记录格式
that everybody has to change their format to some fixed

57
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,248
都改成某种标准的格式
compatible thing.

58
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,128
人们经常这样做 但都没有成功
That's what people often try, and of course it never works.

59
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,340
另一个办法则是重新安排这些记录
Another thing that you might want to do is somehow arrange

60
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,904
让它们中间有这种垂直的抽象屏障
it so you can have these vertical barriers.

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,400
当你查询一份人事档案里的姓名的时候
So that when you ask for the name of a personnel record,

62
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,970
不管它是什么格式 name这个过程都能设法
somehow, whatever format it happens to be, name will

63
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,424
搞清楚怎么正确地完成这件事
figure out how to do the right thing.

64
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,536
我们把name叫做一个 所谓的“通用操作符”
We want name to be, so-called, a generic operator.

65
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,060
通用操作符意味着它会根据数据的种类
Generic operator means what it sort of precisely does depends

66
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,696
准确地做出对应的操作
on the kind of data that it's looking at.

67
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,624
更进一步讲 你想让这个系统在
More than that, you'd like to design the system so that the

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,792
下次公司里多了一个新的人员划分的时候
next time a new division comes into the company

69
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:45,640
人们连接系统的方法不会有很大的变化
they don't have to make any big changes in what they're already doing

70
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,110
并且公司里剩下的部门
to link into this system, and the rest of the company

71
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,016
要把它们的人员记录添加到这个系统
doesn't have to make any big changes

72
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:53,936
也不需要做什么大的修改
to admit their stuff to the system.

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
那么这就是你应该考虑的问题
So that's the problem you should be thinking about.

74
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,770
或者这就是你的工作
Like it's sort of just your work.

75
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,390
你想让这个系统可以用最少的改动来应对新的东西
You want to be able to include new things by making minimal changes.

76
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,128
这就是我们今天要讨论的问题
OK, well that's the problem that we'll be talking about today.

77
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,224
你脑子里应该有这个分布式的人事档案系统
And you should have this sort of distributed personnel record system in your mind.

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,620
但是实际上 我今天要讨论的是一个
But actually the one I'll be talking about is a problem

79
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,480
比那要更加自成体系的问题
that's a little bit more self-contained than that.

80
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:21,760
我觉得用它可以把事情说得更清楚一点
that'll bring up the issues, I think, more clearly.

81
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,016
我们要讨论的是 复数域上的算术系统
That's the problem of doing a system that does arithmetic on complex numbers.

82
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,928
我们来看看这个系统
So let's take a look here.

83
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,536
来复习一下 什么是“复数”
Just as a little review,there are things called complex numbers.

84
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,224
复数z可以看做复平面上的一点
Complex number you can think of as a point in the plane, or z.

85
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:47,190
我们将复数表示为实数部分和虚数部分
And you can represent a point either by its real-part and its imaginary-part.

86
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,832
所以如果这个是复数z 它的实部是这么多
So if this is z and its real-part is this much, and

87
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,248
它的虚部是那么多
its imaginary-part is that much,

88
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,448
我们就可以记z=x+iy
and you write z equals x plus iy.

89
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,210
还有另一种方法来表示一个复数 比如说
Or another way to represent a complex number is by saying,

90
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,008
这个点与原点的距离是多少 在原点的什么角度上
what's the distance from the origin, and what's the angle?

91
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:16,670
像这样 复数也可以表示为半径乘以一个角度
So that represents a complex number as its radius times an angle.

92
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,990
第一种表示法称为 直角坐标系表示 或者说实部-虚部表示
This one's called -- the original one's called rectangular form, rectangular representation, real- and imaginary-part

93
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,040
而后一种是用模和辐角两部分的极坐标表示
or polar representation magnitude and angle--

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,488
并且如果你知道了一个复数的实部和虚部
and if you know the real- and imaginary-part,

95
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,360
你就能计算出它的模和辐角
you can figure out the magnitude and angle.

96
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,976
如果知道了x和y 就能用这个式子算出r
If you know x and y, you can get r by this formula.

97
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,480
等于两个数平方和的平方根 然后就可以
Square root of sum of the squares, and you can get the

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,768
用反三角函数算出辐角的值
angle as an arctangent.

99
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,420
或者反过来 如果你知道了r和A
Or conversely, if you knew r and A you could

100
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,312
你也能计算出x和y
figure out x and y.

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,435
x=r·cosA y=r·sinA
x is r times the cosine of A, and y is r times the sine of A.

102
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,664
这是表示复数的两种不同方法
All right, so there's these two. They're complex numbers.

103
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,150
分别是极坐标形式和直角坐标形式
You can think of them either in polar form or rectangular form.

104
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,280
我们要设计一个复数域上的算术系统
What we would like to do is make a system that does arithmetic on complex numbers.

105
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,056
换句话讲 我们要
In other words, what we'd like--

106
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,992
就像之前课上有理数运算的例子一样
just like the rational number example--

107
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,120
是构造一个叫做+c的操作 它接收
is to have some operations plus c, which is going to take

108
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,640
两个复数然后把它们相加、相减
two complex numbers and add them, subtract them, and

109
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,910
相乘或者相除
multiply them, and divide them.

110
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,280
那么我们要用到一点点数学
OK, well there's little bit of mathematics behind it.

111
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,368
对它们进行操作的具体的算式是什么
What are the actual formulas for manipulating such things?

112
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,920
它们是怎么得出来的 并不重要
And it's sort of not important where they come from,

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,792
我们只是用它们实现运算
but just as an implementer let's see--

114
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,952
如果想要把两个复数相加
if you want to add two complex numbers it's pretty easy to

115
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:42,660
可以很容易地获取它们的实部和虚部
it's pretty easy to get its real-part and its imaginary-part.

116
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,936
两个复数的和的实部
The real-part of the sum of two complex numbers

117
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:54,640
z1+z2的实部 就是z1的实部加上z2的实部
real-part of the z1 plus z2 is the real-part of z1 plus the real-part of z2.

118
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,770
然后z1+z2的虚部也就是
And the imaginary-part of z1 plus z2 is the imaginary part

119
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,472
z1的虚部加上z2的虚部
of z1 plus the imaginary part of z2.

120
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,480
所以复数相加是非常简单的事情
So it's pretty easy to add complex numbers.

121
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,880
你只要把各个部分分别加起来
You just add the corresponding parts

122
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:13,184
然后用结果构建一个新的复数
 and make a new complex number with those parts.

123
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,824
如果你想要让复数相乘 那么在极坐标下运算会方便很多
If you want to multiply them, it's kind of nice to do it in polar form.

124
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,104
因为对于两个复数
Because if you have two complex numbers, the magnitude

125
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,544
它俩积之模 就是它们各自的模的乘积
of their product is here, the product of the magnitudes.

126
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,888
它们的积的辐角 就是两个辐角的和
And the angle of the product is the sum of the angles.

127
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,549
这就是复数域上的运算所需的数学知识
So that's sort of mathematics that allows you to do arithmetic on complex numbers.

128
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,384
我们来想一想具体的实现
Let's actually think about the implementation.

129
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,392
我们就像之前运算有理数那样做
Well we do it just like rational numbers.

130
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,472
我们来到底层 假设我们有一些构造函数子和选择函数子
We come down, we assume we have some constructors and selectors.

131
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,512
它们应该是什么样子呢
What would we like?

132
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,160
假设我们制造了一些表示数据对象的“云彩”
Well let's assume that we make a data object cloud,

133
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,784
也就是用某种形式表示的复数
which is a complex number that has some stuff in it,

134
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,672
我们能从这个复数中得到它的实部
and that we can get out from a complex number the real-part,

135
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,648
虚部 模 或者辐角
or the imaginary-part, or the magnitude, or the angle.

136
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,016
然后我们需要一种方法来构造复数
We want some ways of making complex numbers--

137
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,640
不仅要有选择函数 还要有构造函数
not only selectors, but constructors.

138
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,520
那么假设我们有一个叫做make-rectangular的过程
So we'll assume we have a thing called make-rectangular.

139
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:24,272
这个过程的功能是接受一个实部
What make-rectangular is going to do is take a real-part and

140
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,360
和一个虚部 然后把这两个部分组合成一个复数
an imaginary-part and construct a complex number with those parts.

141
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,010
同样我们也可以构造一个make-polar过程
Similarly, we can have make-polar which will taking

142
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,856
它接受一个模和一个辐角
a magnitude and an angle,

143
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:43,904
然后用这两个值 组成一个复数
and construct a complex number which has that magnitude and angle.

144
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,460
那么这个系统
So here's a system.

145
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,776
里面会有两个构造函数和四个选择函数
We'll have two constructors and four selectors.

146
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:55,150
现在 就像之前课程中那样 我们基于这个抽象的数据结构
And now, just like before, in terms of that abstract data

147
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,220
继续实现复数的各种操作
we'll go ahead and implement our complex number operations.

148
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,304
而这些Lisp代码
And here you can see translated into Lisp code

149
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:07,472
是从我之前写的算术公式“翻译”而来的
just the arithmetic formulas I put down before.

150
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:09,984
如果我想把两个复数相加
If I want to add two complex numbers

151
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,568
我就要用一个实部和一个虚部构造一个复数
I will make a complex number out of its real- and imaginary-parts.

152
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,808
这个新的复数的实部是 两个复数的实部的和
The real part of the complex number I'm going to make is the sum of the real-parts.

153
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,520
它的虚数部分是 两个复数的虚部的和
The imaginary part of the complex number I'm going to make is the sum of the imaginary-parts.

154
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,096
我把它们放到一起 构造出一个复数
I put those together, make a complex number.

155
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,448
这就是实现复数加法的方法
That's how I implement complex number addition.

156
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,496
减法实际上是一样的
Subtraction is essentially the same.

157
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,976
只需要把各个部分相加变成把它们相减
All I do is subtract the parts rather than add them.

158
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,024
要把两个复数相乘
To multiply two complex numbers,

159
00:10:47,744 --> 00:10:49,024
要用另外一个式子
I use the other formula.

160
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,840
我会用一个模和一个辐角来构造一个复数
I'll make a complex number out of a magnitude and angle.

161
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,976
z1*z2模就是 z1的模与z2的模的乘积
The magnitude is going to be the product of the magnitudesof the two complex numbers I'm multiplying.

162
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,512
而z1*z2的辐角则是 的辐角与z2的辐角之和
And the angle is going to be the sum of the angles of the z1two complex numbers I'm multiplying.

163
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,960
那么这就是乘法的实现
So there's multiplication.

164
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,840
然后是除法 除法和乘法几乎是一样的
And then division, division is almost the same.

165
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,584
我只要把两个模相除 把辐角相减就可以了
Here I divide the magnitudes and subtract the angles.

166
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:30,464
现在我已经实现了具体操作
Now I've implemented the operations.

167
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,640
然后我们做什么
And what do we do?

168
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,528
我们把George叫来
We call on George.

169
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,799
我们完成了“使用”的部分 现在应该考虑“表示”了
We've done the use, let's worry about the representation.

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,944
我们叫来George然后对他说
We'll call on George and say to George,

171
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:43,616
“为我们设计一个一套复数的表示方法”
go ahead and build us a complex number representation.

172
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,440
很好
Well that's fine...ahhh

173
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,660
George可能会说 我们把一个复数
George can say, we'll implement a complex number

174
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,152
实现为 一个由实部和虚部组成的序对
simply as a pair that has the real-part and the imaginary-part.

175
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,624
那么如果我想用某个实部和虚部来构造复数
So if I want to make a complex number with a certain real-part and an imaginary-part,

176
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,112
我只需要把它们cons起来即可 -- 这就是George表示复数的方法
I'll just use cons to form a pair, and that will-- that's George's representation of a complex number.

177
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,420
那么如果我想获得它的实部 我只需要
So if I want to get out the real-part of something, I just

178
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,128
提取出序对的car部分 -- 它的首部分
extract the car, the first part.

179
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,672
如果我想要得到虚部 我就提取出它的cdr部分
If I want to get the imaginary-part, I extract the cdr

180
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,776
那对于模和辐角 又该如何取得呢？
How do I deal with the magnitude and angle?

181
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,750
如果我想取得某个复数的模
Well if I want to extract the magnitude of one of these things

182
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:32,304
我需要计算该复数car与cdr的平方和的算术平方根
I get the square root of the sum of the square of the car plus the square of the cdr.

183
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:39,264
如果我想得到辐角 我就计算它的cdr与car比值的反正切
If I want to get the angle, I compute the arctangent of the cdr in the car.

184
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,864
这个Lisp过程用于计算反正切
This is a lisp procedure for computing arctangent.

185
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,592
要是有人给我一个模和辐角
And if somebody hands me a magnitude and an angle

186
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,560
并说：“给我构造一个复数”
and says, make me a complex number,well I compute the

187
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:56,240
用它们计算出实部 r*cos(a) 和虚部 r*sin(a)
well I compute the real-part and the imaginary-part, r * cosine of a and r * sine of a, 

188
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,056
连接成一个序对就行了
and stick them together into a pair.

189
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,260
完成了
OK so we're done.

190
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,752
实际上我做的事情 在概念上讲
In fact, what I just did, conceptually,

191
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,448
和我们之前提过的有理数的表示 是完全没有区别的
is absolutely no different from the rational number representation that we looked at last time.

192
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,910
它们的思想相同
It's the same sort of idea.

193
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,288
写好操作过程 选择一种表示方法
You implement the operators, you pick a representation.

194
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,656
没有什么不同
Nothing different.

195
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,568
现在我们来关心一下Martha
Now let's worry about Martha.

196
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,528
嗯 Martha的想法不太一样
See, Martha has a different idea.

197
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,900
她不想把复数表示成 由实部和虚部组成的序对
She doesn't want to represent a complex number as a pair of a real-part and an imaginary-part.

198
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,170
她比较喜欢把它们表示成
What she would like to do is represent a complex number as

199
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,696
由模和辐角组成的序对
a pair of a magnitude and an angle.

200
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,130
那么如果我们没有让George而是让Martha
So if instead of calling up George we ask Martha to design

201
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,744
来设计复数的表示方法 我们就会得到这样的东西
our representation, we get something like this.

202
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,160
有一个make-polar过程
We get make-polar.

203
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,220
当然了 有了一个模和一个辐角之后
Sure, if I give you a magnitude and an angle we're

204
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,072
我们只要把它们组合成一个序对就行了
just going to form a pair that has magnitude and angle.

205
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,680
如果你想取得复数的模 那很简单
If you want to extract the magnitude, that's easy.

206
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,376
你只需要取序对的car部分即可
You just pull out the car or the pair.

207
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,670
当然 想取得复数的辐角 那也很简单
If you want to extract the angle, sure, that's easy.

208
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,632
只需取cdr部分即可
You just pull out the cdr.

209
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:07,024
但是如果你想要获得实部和虚部
If you want to look for real-parts and imaginary-parts,

210
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:08,496
那就得费点力气
well then you have to do some work.

211
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,580
想得到实部 你就得计算r*cos a
If you want the real-part, you have to get r cosine a.

212
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,990
换句话讲 用序对的car部分去乘以
In other words, r, the car of the pair, times the cosine of

213
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,950
cdr部分的余弦值
the cdr of the pair.

214
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,230
然后你就算出了r*cos(a)
So this is r times the cosine of a,

215
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:27,488
这就是这个复数的实部
and that's the real-part.

216
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,408
要是想算出它的虚部 用r乘以sin(a)就可以了
If you want to get the imaginary-part, it's r times the sine of a.

217
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,930
现在如果我给你一个实部和虚部 然后说
And if I hand you a real-part and an imaginary-part and say,

218
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,030
用它们给我构造一个复数
make me a complex number with that real-part and

219
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,170
那就要先算出
imaginary-part, well I figure out what the magnitude and

220
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,540
模和辐角是多少
angle should be.

221
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,856
模是实部和虚部的平方和的算术平方根
The magnitude's the square root of the sum of the squares

222
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,230
辐角是这个反正切
and the angle's the arctangent.

223
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,224
我用这两个数构造一个序对
I put those together to make a pair.

224
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,170
以上就是Martha的想法
So there's Martha's idea.

225
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,376
那么哪种比较好呢？
Well which is better?

226
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,152
如果你需要做很多加法 那么George的比较好
Well if you're doing a lot of additions, probably George's is better

227
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,616
因为你总是要用到复数的实部和虚部
is better, because you're doing a lot of real-parts and imaginary-parts.

228
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,400
如果你大多数时间都是在做乘法
If mostly you're going to be doing multiplications and divisions,

229
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,140
那可能Martha的办法就要好一些
then maybe Martha's idea is better.

230
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,848
又或者 -- 这就是问题所在了 -- 你决定不了
Or maybe, and this is the real point, you can't decide.

231
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:22,320
或者出于某些个人原因 你想让它们同时存在
Or maybe you just have to let them both hang around, for 
personality reasons.

232
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,768
也可能你是真的无法决定你更喜欢哪种表示法
Maybe you just really can't ever decide what you would like.

233
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,320
回到这个话题 我们真正想要的是这样一个系统
And again, what we would really like is a system that looks like this.

234
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:36,176
这里面 既有George 他实现了
That somehow there's George over here, who has built

235
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:39,648
复数的直角坐标表示
rectangular complex numbers.

236
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,256
又有Martha 她实现了复数的极坐标表示
And Martha, who has polar complex numbers.

237
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:56,896
然后我们有各种操作 用来对复数进行加减乘除
And somehow we have operations that can add, and subtract, and multiply, and divide

238
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:02,790
那么这些操作 不应该被系统中同时存在的两种
and it shouldn't matter that there are two incompatible representations of complex

239
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,984
互不兼容的复数表示方法影响
numbers floating around this system.

240
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,336
或者说 我们不光有像这样的一个抽象屏障
In other words, not only like an abstraction barrier here

241
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,840
它里面有real-part
that has things in it like a real-part,

242
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,712
还有 imaginary-part、magnitude 和 angle 等几个过程
and an imaginary-part, and magnitude,and angle.

243
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,368
不光有一层抽象屏障 把实际的数据表示隐藏起来
So not only is there an abstraction barrier that hides the actual representation from us,

244
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,520
还有一层垂直的屏障
but also there's some kind of vertical barrier here

245
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,408
容许不同的表示方法彼此共存 而不互相干预
that allows both of these representations to exist without interfering with each other.

246
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,072
我们的想法是把这些东西
The idea is that the things in here--

247
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,120
real-part、imaginary-part、magnitude、angle 这些过程
real-part, imaginary-part,magnitude, and angle--

248
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,496
设计成通用操作符
will be generic operators.

249
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,456
如果你调用real-part过程 它就会判断
If you ask for the real-part, it will worry about

250
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:51,312
要在哪一种表示方法中寻找它
what representation it's looking at.

251
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,104
那么我们怎么做到这一点呢
OK, well how can we do that?

252
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,232
实际上有一个很容易想到的办法
There's actually a really obvious idea,

253
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,680
如果你习惯了思考复数的模式
 if you're used to thinking about complex numbers.

254
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,448
如果你已经习惯了复合数据的思想
If you're used to thinking about compound data.

255
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:10,990
假设你只要观察一个复数
See, suppose you could just tell by looking at a complex number

256
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:13,952
就能看出它是被George还是Martha
whether it was constructed 构造出来的
by George or Martha.

257
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,900
换句话说 在你眼前漂浮的这些东西
In other words, so it's not that what's floating around

258
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,910
不是普通的复数 对吗？
here are ordinary, just complex numbers, right?

259
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,944
它们是被某个设计者“构想”出来的
They're fancy, designer complex numbers.

260
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,048
当我们考察一个复数 我们会发现它单纯是个复数
So you look at a complex numbers as it's not just a complex number

261
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,168
它上面有一个标签
it's got a label on it that says,

262
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,752
写着这个是由Martha制造的
that one is by Martha.

263
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,224
或者这个是由George制造的
Or this is a complex number by George.

264
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,392
对吧？它们被签了名字
Right? They're signed.

265
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,155
在这之后 无论何时我们看见一个复数
See, and then whenever we looked at a complex number we

266
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,488
我们只要看它的标签  然后我们就能知道
could just read the label, and then we'd know how you expect

267
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,720
应该怎么对它进行操作
to operate on that.

268
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,190
或者说 我们想要的不只是普通的数据对象
In other words, what we want is not just ordinary data objects.

269
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,370
我们引入一个概念：带类型的数据
We want to introduce the notion of what's called typed data.

270
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,816
带类型的数据就意味着 这里有一朵“云彩”
Typed data means, again, there's some sort of cloud.

271
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,930
它里面有我们之前所说的那种
And what it's got in it is an ordinary data object like

272
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,904
普通的数据对象
we've been thinking about.

273
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,540
这是它的内容 就是实际的数据
Pulled out the contents, sort of the actual data.

274
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,248
它里面还有一个叫做类型的东西 被George或者Martha签了名
But also a thing called a type, but it's signed by either George or Martha.

275
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,272
那么我们现在就要从无类型的数据进入带类型数据的领域
So we're going to go from regular data to type data.

276
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,710
我们怎么构造它
How do we build that?

277
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,504
那很简单
Well that's easy.

278
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,328
我们知道怎么构造“云彩”
We know how to build clouds.

279
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:36,880
我们用序对来组成它们
We can build them out of pairs.

280
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,824
那么我们就有了一种方法来表示带类型的数据
So here's a little representation that supports typed data.

281
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:49,648
这种方法叫做 把类型附加到内容上
There's a thing called take a type and attach it to a piece of contents, 

282
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,640
用cons就可以做到
and we just use cons.

283
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:54,112
然后面对一个带类型的数据 我们就可以知道它的类型
And if we have a piece of typed data, we can look at the type

284
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:56,000
也就是序对的car部分
which is the car.

285
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,304
我们也可以知道它的具体内容 就是它的cdr部分
We can look at the contents,which is the cdr.

286
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:04,288
我们用这种方法使用带类型的数据
Now along with that, the way we use our type data will test,

287
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,264
面对一段类型数据就能知道它是什么类型
when we're given a piece of data, what type it is.

288
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,264
那么我们现在有了几种判断类型的谓词
So we have some type predicates with us.

289
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,730
举例来讲 想要知道一个复数
For example, to see whether a complex number is one of

290
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,860
是不是George构造的 是不是直角坐标表示的 我们只需要看
George's, whether it's rectangular, we just check to

291
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,856
它的“类型”是不是rectangular这个符号
see if the type of that is the symbol rectangular,

292
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,056
对吧？检查 rectangular 符号
right? The symbol rectangular.

293
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,336
同理 想要知道一个复数是不是Martha构造的
And to check whether a complex number is one of Martha's,

294
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,424
我们就看它的“类型”是不是polar这个符号
we check to see whether the type is the symbol polar.

295
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,216
那么这就是一种识别数字的类型的方法
So that's a way to test what kind of number we're looking at.

296
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:42,816
现在来想想 怎么用这种方法来构建系统
Now let's think about how we can use that to build the system.

297
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,736
我们假设George和Martha分别在做各自的工作
So let's suppose that George and Martha were off working separately, 

298
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,640
每一个人都设计了他们的复数表示程序包
and each of them had designed their complex number representation packages.

299
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,528
他们怎么让自己的东西成为系统的一部分
What do they have to do to become part of the system,

300
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:00,140
和对方友好共存呢
 to exist compatibly?

301
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,112
那其实非常简单
Well it's really pretty easy.

302
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,512
回忆一下 George做了这个程序包
Remember, George had this package.

303
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,480
这就是George的程序包 或者说它的一部分
Here's George's original package, or half of it.

304
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,152
然后红色下划线标出的部分是他需要做的修改
And underlined in red are the changes he has to make.

305
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,432
之前 当George用x和y构建了一个复数的时候
So before, when George made a complex number out of an x and y

306
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,856
他只是把它们组合成一个序对
he just put them together to make a pair.

307
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,392
现在唯一不同的地方是 他给它们打了标签
And the only difference is that now he signs them.

308
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,080
他把类型 -- 也就是 rectangular标志符号 -- 附加到这个序对上面
He attaches the type, which is the symbol rectangular to that pair.

309
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,264
剩下的事情都和之前一样 除了一点
Everything else George does is the same, except that--

310
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,064
就是George和Martha的程序都有叫做real-part和imaginary-part的过程
see, George and Martha both have procedures named real-part and imaginary-part.

311
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,960
为了这些过程存在于在同一个Lisp环境中
So to allow them both to exist in the same Lisp environment,

312
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,920
George就要修改他的过程名字
George had changed the names of his procedures.

313
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,145
那么我们说 这是George的real-part过程
So we'll say, this is George's real-part procedure.

314
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,064
叫做real-part-rectangular过程 还有 imag-part-rectangular过程
It's the real-part-rectangular procedure, the imaginary-part-rectangular procedure.

315
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:57,248
那么这里是George的程序包剩下的部分
And then here's the rest of George's package.

316
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,060
他已经有了magnitude和angle过程 只要把它们改名
He'd had magnitude and angle, just renames them magnitude

317
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,160
叫magnitude-rectangular和angle-rectangular就好了
rectangular and angle rectangular.

318
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,968
Martha要做的事情基本相同
And Martha has to do basically the same thing.

319
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:16,224
在这之前 当她用模和辐角构造复数的时候
Martha previously, when she made a complex number out of a magnitude and angle,

320
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,270
她只是把这两个东西cons起来
she just cons them.

321
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,864
现在她额外附加类型 polar
Now she attaches the type polar,

322
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,616
然后修改过程的名字
and she changes the name

323
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:29,850
来避免保证她的real-part过程和George的产生冲突
so her real-part procedure won't conflict in name with George's.

324
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,992
分别改为real-part-polar和imaginary-part-polar
It's a real-part-polar,imaginary-part-polar,

325
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,060
magnitude-polar和angle-polar这四个过程
magnitude polar, and angle polar.

326
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,130
现在我们的系统
Now we have the system.

327
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,920
在它里面既有George又有Martha
Right there's George and Martha.

328
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,680
然后现在我们需要一个经理来对类型进行判断
And now we've got to get some kind of manager to look at these types.

329
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:56,480
那么在George和Martha给我们提供了类型数据之后
How are these things actually going to work now

330
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,408
这个系统现在怎么工作呢？
that George and Martha have supplied us with typed data?

331
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,304
我们手里有的 是一堆通用选择函数
Well what we have are a bunch of generic selectors.

332
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,630
用于复数的通用选择函数比如 real-part、imag-part、magnitude和angle等 
Generic selectors for complex numbers real-part,imaginary-part, magnitude, and angle.

333
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,408
让我们更进一步观察它们
Let's look at them more closely.

334
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,008
real-part过程应该做什么
What does a real-part do?

335
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,768
如果我想得到一个复数的实部
If I ask for the real part of a complex number,

336
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,912
那么我先要观察它
well I look at it.

337
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,690
我观察它的类型
I look at its type.

338
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,128
考虑它是用直角坐标表示的吗
I say, is it rectangular?

339
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,360
如果是的话 我就对这个复数的"内容"部分
If so, I apply George's real part procedure

340
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,920
调用George的real-part过程
to the contents of that complex number.

341
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,944
这是一个带有类型的数字
This is a number that has a type on it.

342
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,664
我用contents过程剥掉类型 并且对它应用George的过程
I strip off the type using contents and apply George's procedure.

343
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,864
那如果是一个用极坐标表示的复数呢？
Or is this a polar complex number?

344
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,976
如果我想要得到它的实部
If I want the real part,

345
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:58,780
我就把Martha的real-part过程应用在这个数的内容上
 I apply Martha's real-part procedure to the contents of that number.

346
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,152
这就是real-part工作的方式
So that's how real part works.

347
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,664
还有类似的imag-part过程 几乎是一样的
And then similarly there's imaginary-part, which is almost the same.

348
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,600
它先观察这个数字 它是直角坐标表示的
Right? It looks at the number and if it's rectangular, uses

349
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,130
就调用George的imaginary-part过程
George's imaginary-part procedure.

350
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,832
是极坐标表示的 就用Martha的过程
If it's polar, uses Martha's.

351
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,408
同理也可以构造出magnitude和angle两个过程
And then there's a magnitude and an angle.

352
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,024
我们的系统是这个样子
So there's a system.

353
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,260
它里面有三个部分
Has three parts.

354
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,592
有George、Martha和一个经理
There's sort of George, and Martha, and the manager.

355
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,970
这就是实现通用操作符的方法
And that's how you get generic operators implemented.

356
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,928
为了把它说清楚 我们举一个简单的实例
Let's look at just a simple example, just to pin it down.

357
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,120
但是准确描述了它工作的方式
But exactly how this is going to work,

358
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:43,984
假设你现在 面对一个实部是1
suppose you're going to be looking at the complex number who's real-part is one,

359
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:46,090
虚部是2的复数
and who's imaginary-part is two.

360
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,448
也就是1+2i
So that would be one plus 2i.

361
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,640
现在在这里 
What would happen is up here,

362
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,536
在操作发生的上层
up here above where the operations have to happen,

363
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:08,272
复数被表示成一个由1和2组成的序对加上类型信息
that number would be represented as a pair of 1 and 2 together with type data.

364
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,392
（1和2）是内容
That would be the contents.

365
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:17,960
整个的数据就是在那之上加上一个rectangular符号
And the whole data would be that thing with the symbol rectangular added onto that.

366
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:21,536
这就是复数在这个系统里存在的形式
And that's the way that complex number would exist in the system.

367
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,928
你要调取real-part的时候
When you went to take the real-part,

368
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,896
经理会检查这个数然后说 这是George构造的数字
the manager will look at this and say, oh it's one of George's.

369
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,536
他会先把类型拿掉
He'll strip off the type

370
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:36,912
然后把 (1,2) 这个序对传递给George
 and hand down to George the pair 1, 2.

371
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,272
这是George的系统可以直接处理的数据
And that's the kind of data that George developed his system to use.

372
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:45,920
那么它被拆了出来
So it gets stripped down.

373
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:49,760
之后 如果你让George构造一个复数
Later on, if you ask George to construct a complex number,

374
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,560
George就会把它构造成序对
George would construct some complex number as a pair,

375
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:58,240
在数据被传递到上层之前
and before he passes it back up through the manager would

376
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,136
经理会再给它加上rectangular类型
attach the type rectangular.

377
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,650
看这个过程
So you see what happens.

378
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,850
这个系统不会发生混乱
There's no confusion in this system.

379
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,848
就算在Martha的世界里 序对(1 2)的含义完全不同
It doesn't matter in the least that the pair 1, 2

380
00:25:13,504 --> 00:25:15,750
也并没有什么影响
means something completely different in Martha's world.

381
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,440
在Martha的世界里这个序对代表了
In Martha's world this pair means the complex number whose

382
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,784
一个模为1 辐角为2的复数
magnitude is 1 and whose angle is 2.

383
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,192
但是这并不会造成混乱
And there's no confusion,

384
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:27,250
因为每当有一个这样的序对经由经理之手
 because by the time any pair like this gets handed back through the manager to the

385
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,616
被交给主系统的时候 它都会被附加上polar的类型标志
main system it's going to have the type polar attached.

386
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,670
而这个就会被贴上rectangular类型的标签
Whereas this one would have the type rectangular attached.

387
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,904
好 我们休息一下
OK, let's take a break.

388
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,307
[音乐]
[MUSIC-- "JESU, JOY OF
MAN'S DESIRING" BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH]

389
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,150
我们刚刚提出了一种实现通用操作符的策略
We just looked at a strategy for implementing generic operators.

390
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:31,400
这种策略有一个名字 叫做“基于类型的分派”
That strategy has a name: it's called dispatch on type.

391
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:39,360
它的想法就是你要把你的系统分成很多小块
And the idea is that you break your system into a bunch of pieces.

392
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,672
里面有George和Martha在设计表示方法
There's George and Martha, who are making representations,

393
00:26:43,376 --> 00:26:44,384
还有一个经理
and then there's the manager.

394
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,064
负责去看数据上的类型是什么
Looks at the types on the data

395
00:26:48,512 --> 00:26:50,592
然后分派给正确的人去处理
and then dispatches them to the right person.

396
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,016
这种组织系统的方法有什么缺点呢？
Well what criticisms can we make of that as a system organization?

397
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,400
首先 有个小小的烦人的问题
Well first of all there was this little, annoying problem

398
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,056
George和Martha需要修改他们的过程的名字
that George and Martha had to change the names of their procedures

399
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,952
George一开始写了一个real-part过程
George originally had a real-part procedure,

400
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:08,288
现在他必须把它的名字改成real-part-rectangular
and he had to go name it real-part rectangular

401
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,832
才能让它不与Martha的real-part过程相互冲突
 so it wouldn't interfere with Martha's real-part procedure,

402
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:12,768
而Martha的过程现在改叫real-part-polar
which is now named real-part-polar,

403
00:27:13,648 --> 00:27:17,310
这是为了不和经理的那个叫做real-part的过程发生冲突
 so it wouldn't interfere with the manager's real-part procedure, who's now named real-part.

404
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,460
这确实是很烦人的事情
That's kind of an annoying problem.

405
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,270
但是我现在暂时不讨论这个问题
But I'm not going to talk about that one now.

406
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,450
我们在之后讨论到Lisp名称与环境
We'll see later on when we think about the structure of

407
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,480
的结构的时候就会知道 我们有办法
Lisp names and environments that there really are ways to

408
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,390
把这些所谓的命名空间分开来封装
package all those so-called name spaces separately so they

409
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,500
然后它们就不会互相影响了
don't interfere with each other.

410
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,720
现在我们暂时不去考虑这个问题
Not going to think about that problem now.

411
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,740
我现在想关注的问题是
The problem that I actually want to focus on is what

412
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,510
你把一个新人招纳进系统之中会发生什么
happens when you bring somebody new into the system.

413
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,320
会发生什么
What has to happen?

414
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,690
George和Martha并不关心
Well George and Martha don't care.

415
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,830
George坐在他的直角坐标世界里
George is sitting there in his rectangular world, has his

416
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,090
坐拥着他的过程和数据类型们
procedures and his types.

417
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,260
而Martha待在她的极坐标世界中
Martha sits in her polar world.

418
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,380
也不关心外面发生了什么
She doesn't care.

419
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,540
但是我们来看看我们的经理
But let's look at the manager.

420
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,180
经理需要做什么
What's the manager have to do?

421
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,360
现在经理来了 带着他的操作符
The manager comes through and had these operations.

422
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,040
有直角坐标的判断
There was a test for rectangular

423
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,140
和极坐标的判断过程
and a test for polar.

424
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:17,210
如果Harry进入这个系统 他带着某种新型的复数表示方法
If Harry comes in with some new kind of complex number,

425
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,430
同时带来了一个新的类型 Harry型复数
and Harry has a new type, Harry type complex number, the

426
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:25,240
经理就需要修改他所有的过程
manager has to go in and change all those procedures.

427
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,940
所以这个系统的不灵活之处
So the inflexibility in the system, the place where work

428
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,890
需要大量工作才能适应变化的地方 就在这个经理身上
has to happen to accommodate change, is in the manager.

429
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,990
那是非常恼人的事情
That's pretty annoying.

430
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,300
更恼人的是你意识到这个经理实际上
It's even more annoying when you realize the manager's not

431
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,590
什么也不做
doing anything.

432
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,690
他只会坐在办公室摆弄公文
The manager is just being a paper pusher.

433
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,760
我们再来看看这些程序 它们在做什么
Let's look again at these programs. What are they doing?

434
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
real-part过程在做什么
What does real-part do?

435
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,170
这个过程说 哦 这个复数是
Real-part says, oh, is it the kind of complex number that

436
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,000
George会处理的那一种吗
George can handle?

437
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,410
如果是的话 好 把它交给George处理
If so, send it off to George.

438
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,910
它是Martha能操作的那一种吗
Is it the kind of complex number that Martha can handle?

439
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,040
是的话 把它交给Martha处理
If so, send it off to Martha.

440
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,720
所以非常恼人的一件事就是这个系统的瓶颈
So it's really annoying that the bottleneck in this system,

441
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,040
降低灵活性 阻碍变化的那个东西
the thing that's preventing flexibility and change, is

442
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,000
完全是一个没用的官僚
completely in the bureaucracy.

443
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,700
而不是任何做实事的人
It's not in anybody who's doing any of the work.

444
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,300
很可惜这种情况经常发生
Not an uncommon situation,unfortunately.

445
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,570
实际上发生的事情是
See, what's really going on--

446
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,100
在系统中，有一张抽象的表格
abstractly in the system,there's a table.

447
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,150
实际发生的事情是有这样一张表格
So what's really happening is somewhere there's a table.

448
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,400
这里是各种类型
There're types.

449
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,565
有polar和rectangular
There's polar and rectangular.

450
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,380
可能Harry也在这里
And Harry's may be over here.

451
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,050
然后这里是各种操作
And there are operators.

452
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,340
各种操作 像real-part
There's an operator like real-part.

453
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,010
和imaginary-part
Or imaginary-part.

454
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:05,830
还有magnitude angle这些操作符
Or a magnitude and angle.

455
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:19,280
然后表格里面是(对这种类型做这种操作)应该使用的过程
And sitting in this table are the right procedures.

456
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,990
那么填在这里负责polar类型的real-part操作的是
So sitting here for the type polar and real-part is

457
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,730
Martha的real-part-polar过程
Martha's procedure real-part-polar.

458
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,740
然后在这里是George的
And over here in the table is George's procedure

459
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,990
real-part-rectangular过程
real-part-rectangular.

460
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,680
然后这里是Martha的
And over here would be, say,Martha's procedure

461
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,780
magnitude-polar过程 和George的
magnitude-polar, and George's procedure

462
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,760
magnitude-rectangular过程 等等等等
magnitude-rectangular,right, and so on.

463
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,390
表格里剩下的空格也像这样填好
The rest of this table's filled in.

464
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,260
这就是实际上发生的事情
And that's really what's going on.

465
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,380
从某种意义上讲 经理做的事情就是
So in some sense, all the manager is doing is acting as

466
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,630
去扮演这张表格
this table.

467
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,610
那我们怎么去改进这个系统呢
Well how do we fix our system?

468
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,770
怎么去消灭这种官僚主义
How do you fix bureaucracies a lot of the time?

469
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,240
你要做的就是让这个经理走人
What you do is you get rid of the manager.

470
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,170
我们把他赶走 用一台计算机来代替他
We just take the manager and replace him by a computer.

471
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,320
我们要让自动操作抹掉他存在的意义
We're going to automate him out of existence.

472
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,970
也就是说 我们不用这个经理去查阅
Namely, instead of having the manager who basically consults

473
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,020
这个表格 而是让我们的系统直接去查阅它
this table, we'll have our system use the table directly.

474
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,110
我的意思是什么呢
What do I mean by that?

475
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:38,730
我们来假设 还是用数据抽象的观点 我们有
Let's assume, again using data abstraction, that we have some

476
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,880
这样一种表格数据结构
kind of data structure that's a table.

477
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,080
而且我们还有把东西填进去
And we have ways of sticking things in and ways of getting

478
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,356
和从中删除的方法
things out.

479
00:31:44,356 --> 00:31:47,000
为了把话说清楚 我们可以假设
And to be explicit, let me assume that there's an

480
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,710
我们现在有一个叫put的方法 这个方法需要两个
operation called "put." And put is going to take, in this

481
00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:00,130
我们把它叫做key(关键字)的东西 key1和key2
case two things I'll call "keys." Key1 and key2.

482
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,380
还有一个值
And a value.

483
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,490
这个过程把这个值存放在表格中key1和key2对应的格子里
And that stores the value in the table under key1 and key2.

484
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,530
然后我们假设有另一个过程叫get
And then we'll assume there's a thing called "get," such

485
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,680
它是这样的一个东西 如果我说把表格里
that if later on I say, get me what's in the table stored

486
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,010
key1和key2对应的格子中的数据给我 它就会返回给我
under key1 and key2, it'll retrieve whatever value was

487
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,730
那里的东西
stored there.

488
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,000
我们先不要担心这个表格怎么实现
And let's not worry about how tables are implemented.

489
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,060
那又是另一个数据抽象了，是George需要考虑的问题
That's yet another data abstraction, George's problem.

490
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,700
也许以后我们还会看到
And maybe we'll see later--

491
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,970
我们还会讨论怎么用lisp建立这个表格
talk about how you might actually build tables in Lisp.

492
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,850
我们有了这个组织结构 George和Martha
Well given this organization,what did George and Martha

493
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,380
需要做什么呢
have to do?

494
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,010
当他们构建自己的系统的时候
Well when they build their system, they each have the

495
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,750
他们两个都要负责在表格里
responsibility to set up their appropriate

496
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,210
正确地添加上自己的那一列
column in the table.

497
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,920
那么George，比如说，当他定义他的过程的时候
So what George does, for example, when he defines his procedures

498
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,020
他需要做的就是把它们放进
all he has to do is go off and put into the

499
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,990
表格中的rectangular类型的那一列下面
table under the type-rectangular.

500
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,100
然后操作的名字是real-part
And the name of the operation is real-part, his procedure

501
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,250
他放入他的real-part-rectangular过程
real-part-rectangular.

502
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,780
注意有什么被放到了表格里
So notice what's going into this table.

503
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,100
这里的两个key是rectangular和real-part这两个记号
The two keys here are symbols,rectangular and real-part.

504
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,400
加上引号表示它是一个符号数据
That's the quote.

505
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,410
要被填到表里的东西是他编写的
And what's going into the table is the actual procedure

506
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,870
real-part-rectangular过程
that he wrote, real-part rectangular.

507
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,000
然后把这个获取虚部的过程也放进表里
And then puts an imaginary part into the table, filed

508
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,370
分类到rectangular和imaginary-part两个关键字之下
under the keys rectangular and imaginary-part, and

509
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:44,020
获取模值的过程放到rectangular和magnitude下面
magnitude under the keys rectangular magnitude, angle

510
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,270
获取辐角的过程放到rectangular和angle下面
under rectangular-angle.

511
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,840
George要成为系统的一部分，就要做以上这些事情
So that's what George has to do to be part of this system.

512
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,740
Martha用同样的方法填好表格中
Martha similarly sets up the column and

513
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,430
polar的这一列
the table under polar.

514
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:02,160
在polar和real-part对应的这一栏
Polar and real-part.

515
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,340
应该填的过程是real-part-polar 是吧
Is the procedure real-part-polar?

516
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:09,030
然后是imaginary-part,magnitude和angle
And imaginary-part, and magnitude, and angle.

517
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,409
Martha想要加入系统当中就要做这些事情
So this is what Martha has to do to be part of the system.

518
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,550
每个设计了数据表示的人
Everyone who makes a representation has the

519
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,840
都必须在表格里设置自己的一列
responsibility for setting up a column in the table.

520
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,900
那么Harry带着他的绝妙的复数实现方法
And what does Harry do when Harry comes in with his

521
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,800
过来的时候 他需要做什么呢
brilliant idea for implementing complex numbers?

522
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,170
他把他的过程写好
Well he makes whatever procedure he wants and builds

523
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,550
然后在表格里再建立一列
a new column in this table.

524
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,330
那么现在经理怎么样了呢
OK, well what happened to the manager?

525
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,610
经理的存在被自动操作所取代
The manager has been automated out of existence and is

526
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,110
被一个叫做operate的过程代替
replaced by a procedure called operate.

527
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,380
这是这个系统最关键的一个过程
And this is the key procedure in the whole system.

528
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:45,920
我们写下 define operate
Let's say define operate.

529
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,750
Operate过程接收你想要做的操作
Operate is going to take an operation that you want to do,

530
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,840
应该说是这个操作的名字，和你想要把操作
the name of an operation, and an object that you would like

531
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,210
应用于其上的那个对象
to apply that operation to.

532
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,400
那么举例来说 对一个复数调用real-part
So for example, the real-part of some particular complex

533
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,890
operate会做什么呢
number, what does it do?

534
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,650
它要做的第一件事就是去查表
Well the first thing it does,it looks in the table.

535
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:20,710
它翻阅这个表格，试图去找到写在表格里
Goes into the table and tries to find a procedure that's

536
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,320
的一个过程
stored in the table.

537
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:29,830
所以它要对表格调用get过程 用对象的类型
So it gets from the table, using as keys the type of the

538
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:40,450
和操作的名称作为关键字 这样就可以
object and the operator, but looks on the table and sees

539
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,300
知道在表格中 与数据的类型和要进行的操作
what's stored under the type of the object and the

540
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,440
对应的这一格里填了什么东西
operator, sees if anything's stored.

541
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,930
我们假设get过程已经被实现好了
Let's assume that get is implemented.

542
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:52,560
所以如果在那一格什么也没有 它就会返回一个空表
So if nothing is stored there,it'll return the empty list.

543
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,130
如果那里确实有什么东西
So it says, if there's actually something stored

544
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:04,920
如果有这样的一个过程 那么它就会
there, if the procedure here is not no, then it'll take the

545
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,240
把它在表里找到的这个过程应用到
procedure that it found in the table and apply it to the

546
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,120
对象的具体内容上去
contents of the object.

547
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:21,445
如果那里没有东西的话 它就会
And otherwise if there was nothing stored there, it'll--

548
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,435
我们可以决定
well we can decide.

549
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,920
我们让它输出一个错误消息
In this case let's have it put out an error message saying,

550
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,650
未定义的操作符
undefined operator.

551
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,230
没有支持这种类型的操作
No operator for this type.

552
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,285
或者其它合适的错误信息
Or some appropriate error message.

553
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,300
跟上了吗
OK?

554
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,890
那么我们用这个东西替换了经理
And that replaces the manager.

555
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,960
我们怎么去使用它呢
How do we really use it?

556
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,580
我们的想法是operate过程
Well what we say is we'll go off and define our generic

557
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,040
来定义我们的通用选择函数
selectors using operate.

558
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,140
我们可以说一个对象的real-part
We'll say that the real-part of an object is found by

559
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:05,010
是这个对象被operate应用了叫做real-part的操作后
operating on the object with the name of the operation

560
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,260
得到的结果
being real-part.

561
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,870
那么类似地，imaginary-part是operate对其应用
And then similarly,imaginary-part is operate

562
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:16,080
imaginary-part操作后得到的结果 magnitude和angle同理
using the name imaginary-part and magnitude and angle.

563
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,430
这就是我们的实现方法
That's our implementation.

564
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,330
由它们加上类型再加上operate过程组成
That plus the type plus the operate procedure.

565
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,100
那么这个表格现在就有效地完成了
And the table effectively replaces what the

566
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,150
之前由经理完成的工作
manager used to do.

567
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,040
我们来梳理一下在这个过程中
Let's just go through that slowly to show you

568
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,900
发生的事情
what's going on.

569
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,000
假设我有一个由Martha构造的复数
Suppose I have one of Martha's complex numbers.

570
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,100
它的模值是1，辐角是2
It's got magnitude 1 and angle 2.

571
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,220
它是由Martha构造的
And it's one of Martha's.

572
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:47,120
所以它被贴上了polar的标签
So it's labeled here, polar.

573
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,000
我们叫它z
Let's call that z.

574
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,250
假设这就是z
Suppose that's z.

575
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,320
然后假设在这种实现方法下
And suppose with this implementation someone comes

576
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,110
有人想要对z应用real-part操作
up and asks for the real-part of z.

577
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,920
那么real-part现在是用operate来定义的
Well real-part now is defined in terms of operate.

578
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:18,470
这就等同于说对它调用operate
So that's equivalent to saying operate with the name of the

579
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:27,060
real-part作为操作符 应用到z上
operator being real-part, the symbol real-part on z.

580
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,090
然后operate过程
And now operate comes.

581
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,720
就会去查询表格 然后试图去
It's going to look in the table,and it's going to try

582
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,005
寻找在表格里存放的
and find something stored under--

583
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,160
查询表格中哪一栏和
the operation is going to apply by looking in the table

584
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,225
这个对象的类型相对应
under the type of the object.

585
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,790
那么z的类型是polar
And the type of z is polar.

586
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,990
所以它就要说 我用polar作为关键字查表
So it's going to look and say,can I get using polar?

587
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,250
然后操作的名称 是real-part
And the operation name,which was real-part.

588
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,490
它查询对应的过程
It's going to look in there and apply that to

589
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:14,930
然后应用到z的内容上去
the contents of z.

590
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:20,350
如果所有东西都安排妥当的话
If everything was set up correctly, this thing is the

591
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,700
它找到的过程就是Martha放在那里的过程
procedure that Martha put there.

592
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,950
就是real-part-polar.
This is real-part-polar.

593
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,130
然后这就是z去掉类型之后的东西
And this is z without its type.

594
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,860
是Martha最初设计过程
The thing that Martha originally designed those

595
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,340
用来处理的那种东西 在这里是序对(1 2)
procedures to work on,which is 1, 2.

596
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,210
所以说在整个系统中operate过程
And so operate sort of does uniformly what the manager

597
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,450
和之前的经理做的事情没什么区别
used to do sort of all over the system.

598
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,170
它找到正确的东西 查询表格
It finds the right thing, looks in the table, strips off

599
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,600
剥掉类型的外衣 然后把它传递给
the type, and passes it down into the

600
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,160
能够处理它的人
person who handles it.

601
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,980
这是另一种 你会发现在大多数情况下
This is another, and, you can see, more flexible for most

602
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,990
更灵活的实现通用操作符的方法
purposes, way of implementing generic operators.

603
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:16,505
我们把它叫做数据驱动编程
And it's called data-directed programming.

604
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,920
它的想法是 在某种意义上这些数据对象
And the idea of that is in some sense the data objects

605
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,260
本身 这些在系统里漂浮的
themselves, those little complex numbers that are

606
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,340
小小的复数 它们自身就携带关于
floating around the system,are carrying with them the

607
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:35,390
应该怎么去操作它们 这样的信息
information about how you should operate on them.

608
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,640
我们暂停一下 大家可以提问
Let's break for questions.

609
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,240
好
Yes.

610
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,390
学生：你在那个数据对象里存储的是什么呢
AUDIENCE: What do you have stored in that data object?

611
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,850
这里面有这个数据本身 还有它的类型
You have the data itself, you have its type, and you have

612
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,690
还有对那个类型的操作过程
the operations for that type?

613
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,600
或者说这些操作 被放在哪里呢
Or where are the operations that you found?

614
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,980
教授：好，让我——
PROFESSOR: OK, let me--

615
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,500
啊 那是一个好问题
yeah, that's a good question.

616
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,700
通过它可以想到实现我们目标的
Because it raises other possibilities of how

617
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,750
其它可能的方法
you might do it.

618
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,200
当然可能的方法有很多
And of course there are a lot of possibilities.

619
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,820
在我们的这种实现当中
In this particular implementation, what's sitting

620
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,630
在这个数据对象里放着的 是数据本身
in this data object, for example, is the data itself--

621
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,980
在这个例子就是1和2组成的序对
which in this case is a pair of 1 and 2--

622
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,550
和一个标志
and also a symbol.

623
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,140
这就是那个标志 单词P-O-L-A-R
This is the symbol, the word P-O-L-A-R, and that's what's

624
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,390
这些就是这个数据对象里面的东西
sitting in this data object.

625
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,690
这些操作本身在哪里呢
Where are the operations themselves?

626
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,850
这些操作在表格里
The operations are sitting in the table.

627
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:35,450
在这个表格里 所有行和列的名字
So in this table, the rows and columns of the table are

628
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,230
都是前面说的标志
labeled by symbols.

629
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,810
所以当我往里面存什么东西的时候 关键字可以是
So when I store something in this table, the key might be

630
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:48,240
polar标志与magnitude标志这样的东西
the symbol polar and the symbol magnitude.

631
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,310
我这样写下它可能让你们感到困惑了
And I think by writing it this way I've been very confusing.

632
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,160
因为在这里面放的并不是
Because what's really sitting here isn't--

633
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:58,360
当我写下magnitude-polar的时候 我想要表达的是那个
when I wrote magnitude polar, what I mean is the procedure

634
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,850
叫magnitude-polar的过程
magnitude polar.

635
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,580
大概我本来应该在这里写上
And probably what I really should have written--

636
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,200
但是这里空间太小了
except it's too small for me to write

637
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,580
我写不下
in this little space--

638
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,250
应该写成lambda(z)什么什么 这样的东西
is something like lambda of z, the thing that

639
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,710
或者说Martha实现的过程本身
Martha wrote to implement.

640
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,620
从这里你可以看出来 我已经暗示了
And then you can see from that,there's another way that

641
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,250
解决这个名字冲突问题的另一个方法
I alluded to of solving this name conflict problem, which

642
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,380
那就是George和Martha根本不用给他们的
is that George and Martha never have to name their

643
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,150
过程起名字
procedures at all.

644
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,710
他们可以直接把由lambda标识的
They can just stick the anonymous things generated by

645
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,660
匿名函数放进表格里
lambda directly into the table.

646
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,540
你的问题还引出了另一种可能性
There's also another thing that your question raises, is

647
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,045
就是也许我想存储在
the possibility that maybe what I would like somehow is

648
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:40,120
这个数据对象里的 不是POLAR这个标志
to store in this data object not the symbol P-O-L-A-R but

649
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,520
而是所有这些操作本身
maybe actually all the operations themselves.

650
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,860
那就是组织这个系统的另一个方法
And that's another way to organize the system, called

651
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,650
叫做消息传递
message passing.

652
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,970
所以说有很多方法来实现我们的目标
So there are a lot of ways you can do it.

653
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,040
学生：所以说如果Martha和George
AUDIENCE: Therefore if Martha and George had used the same

654
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,230
用了相同的过程名字也没什么问题
procedure names, it would be OK because it wouldn't look

655
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,560
因为它不会看起来
it wouldn't look

656
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,889
教授：对 对
PROFESSOR: That's right.That's right.

657
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,060
看 他们甚至根本不需要
See, they wouldn't even have to name their

658
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,470
给他们的过程起名字
procedures at all.

659
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,440
George放在表格里
What George could have written instead of saying put in the

660
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,890
rectangular和real-part对应的格子里的东西
table under rectangular- and real-part, the procedure

661
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,660
可以不是real-part-rectangular这个过程
real-part rectangular, George could have written put under

662
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,080
他也可以在这个格子里放一个lambda(z)然后什么什么
rectangular real-part, lambda of z, such and such,

663
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,540
这样一个匿名函数
and such and such.

664
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,330
整个系统会以完全相同的方式工作
And the system would work completely the same.

665
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,000
学生：我的问题是 就算Martha在key1和key2对应的格子里
AUDIENCE: My question is, Martha could have put key1 key2

666
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,120
放了real-part过程 George也在key1和key2下
real-part, and George could have put key1 key2

667
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,060
放了一个real-part 只要他们对这个过程的定义不一样
real-part, and as long as they defined them differently they

668
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,290
就不会发生任何冲突 对吗
wouldn't have had any conflicts, right?

669
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,130
教授：对的 这完全没有问题
PROFESSOR: Yes, that would all be OK except for the fact that

670
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,130
除非你说的是George和Martha在同一个终端上工作
if you imagine George and Martha typing at the same

671
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,090
并且他们两个人起的所有名字的含义全部相同
console with the same meanings for all their names, and it

672
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,720
那么同样的real-part就会造成困扰
would get confused by real-part,but there are ways

673
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,800
但是就算是这种情况也有办法解决
to arrange that, too.

674
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,980
从原则上讲你说的完全正确
And in principle you're absolutely right.

675
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,290
如果他们的名字不互相冲突的话
If their names didn't conflict--

676
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,190
被填到表里的是对象本身 而不是它们的名字
it's the objects that go in the table, not the names.

677
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,450
好 我们休息一下
OK, let's take a break.

678
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:25,086
[音乐]
[MUSIC-- "JESU, JOY OF
MAN'S DESIRING" BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH]

679
00:44:25,086 --> 00:44:56,880
（黑屏至44:57）

680
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,680
好的 我们刚刚讲了一个数据驱动编程的例子
All right, well we just looked at data-directed programming

681
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,590
它是一个对复数做算术运算的系统
as a way of implementing a system that does arithmetic on

682
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,840
它是一个对复数做算术运算的系统
complex numbers.

683
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,880
我已经在里面实现了这些操作 +c -c
So I had these operations in it called plus C and minus C,

684
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,230
乘法 除法 还有其它的一些过程
and multiply, and divide,and maybe some others.

685
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:46,030
这些过程存在于上层 这就是问题的关键
And that sat on top of-- and this is the key point-- sat on

686
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:50,340
存在于两种不同表示方式的上层
top of two different representations.

687
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:56,110
这是一个直角坐标程序包 这里一个极坐标程序包
A rectangular package here,and a polar package.

688
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,150
可能还有其它的东西
And maybe some more.

689
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,640
我们已经看到通过我们的想法
And we saw that the whole idea is that maybe some more are

690
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,670
那些“其它的东西”可以很容易地添加上去
now very easy to add.

691
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,900
但是那并没有真正体现出这种方法的威力
But that doesn't really show the power of this methodology.

692
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,150
我们看看发生了什么
Shows you what's going on.

693
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,260
这个方法的威力 你在更复杂的系统中
The power of the methodology only becomes apparent when you

694
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,080
应用它的时候 才会体现出来
start embedding this in some more complex system.

695
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,180
现在我就要把它应用在一个
What I'm going to do now is embed this in some more

696
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,250
更复杂的系统里面
complex system.

697
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,960
我们假设我们编写的是一个
Let's assume that what we really have is a general kind

698
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,280
适用于各种数的算术系统
of arithmetic system.

699
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,240
所谓的通用算术系统
So called generic arithmetic system.

700
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,060
然后在系统的最顶层 可以命令它
And at the top level here,somebody can say add two

701
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:38,450
把两个东西相加 或者相减
things, or subtract two things,or multiply two

702
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,180
或者相乘、相除
things, or divide two things.

703
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,930
然后在它们下面是一个抽象屏障
And underneath that there's an abstraction barrier.

704
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,510
在这个抽象屏障的下层是 我们说
And underneath this barrier,is, say, a

705
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,850
是一个复数运算程序包
complex arithmetic package.

706
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:55,110
然后你可以让它把两个复数相加
And you can say, add two complex numbers.

707
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,540
或者你还可以 还记得我们的有理数
Or you might also have--remember we did a rational

708
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,190
程序包吗 可以把它也放在这里面
number package-- you might have that sitting there.

709
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,950
可以放进去有理数
And there might be a rational thing.

710
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,760
然后有理数程序包里面
And the rational number package,well, has the things

711
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,320
有我们实现的
we implemented.

712
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:15,490
+rat,*rat等等的这些过程
Plus rat, and times rat, and so on.

713
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,010
或者你还可以加上普通的lisp数字
Or you might have ordinary Lisp numbers.

714
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,310
你可以让它把3和4加起来
You might say add three and four.

715
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:29,030
那么我们在这个系统里加入普通数字的运算
So we might have ordinary numbers, in which case we have

716
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:36,670
我们用Lisp自带的加减乘除过程来实现
the Lisp supplied plus, and minus, and times, and slash.

717
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,840
总而言之 在下一个阶段 我们想象这个复数运算系统
OK, so we might imagine this complex number system sitting

718
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,660
存在于一个更加复杂的
in a more complicated generic operator structure at

719
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,910
通用运算系统里面
the next level up.

720
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,050
我们怎么才能做到呢
Well how can we make that?

721
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,240
我们已经有了想法
We already have the idea, we're just

722
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,780
现在只要再一次应用它就可以了
going to do it again.

723
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,720
我们之前实现了一个有理数程序包
We've implemented a rational number package.

724
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,650
那么我们来看看应该怎么修改它
Let's look at how it has to be changed.

725
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,660
实际上 在这个层面
In fact, at this level it doesn't have to

726
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,730
它根本就不需要修改
be changed at all.

727
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:07,180
这完全就是我们上次写的那些代码
This is exactly the code that we wrote last time.

728
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,140
要把两个有理数相加
To add two rational numbers, remember

729
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,140
回忆一下我们要用到这个公式
there was this formula.

730
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,980
构造一个有理数 它的分子是
You make a rational number whose numerator--

731
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,330
第一个数的分子乘以第二个数的分母
the numerator of the first times the denominator of the

732
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,486
加上第一个数的分母乘以
second, plus the denominator of the first times the

733
00:48:20,486 --> 00:48:21,520
第二个数的分子
numerator of the second.

734
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,760
而结果的分母是两个分母的乘积
And who's denominator is the product of the denominators.

735
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,580
然后是-rat,*rat,/rat这些过程
And minus rat, and star rat, and slash rat.

736
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,420
这就是我们之前写的那个
And this is exactly the rational number package that

737
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,310
有理数运算程序包
we made before.

738
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,390
我们忽略了最大公约数的问题
We're ignoring the GCD problem,but let's not worry

739
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,240
我们先不去考虑那个
about that.

740
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,980
作为这个有理数包的具体实现
As implementers of this rational number package, how

741
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,570
我们怎么把它安装到我们的通用运算系统中呢
do we install it in the generic arithmetic system?

742
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,820
那很简单
Well that's easy.

743
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,840
我们要做的事只有一件和之前不同
There's only one thing we have to do differently.

744
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,270
在之前我们说构造一个有理数
Whereas previously we said that to make a rational number

745
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,960
就是构造一个由分子分母组成的序对
you built a pair of the numerator and denominator,

746
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,300
现在我们不光构造这个序对 还要给它贴上标签
here we'll not only build the pair, but we'll sign it.

747
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,120
把rational的类型标志附加上去
We'll attach the type rational.

748
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,940
这就是唯一和之前不一样的地方
That's the only thing we have to do different, make it a

749
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,380
把有理数变成类型数据
typed data object.

750
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,500
现在我们要把我们的操作放进表格里
And now we'll stick our operations in the table.

751
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,920
我们在rational标志和add操作对应的格子里
We'll put under the symbol rational and the operation add

752
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,820
放进我们的+rat过程
our procedure, plus rat.

753
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,580
并且再一次注意 这是一个标志
And, again, note this is a symbol.

754
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:23,930
对吧
Right?

755
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,830
加上引号 加上引号 但是实际上放进表里的
Quote, and quote, but the actual thing we're putting in the table

756
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,060
是过程本身
is the procedure.

757
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,700
然后怎么做减法
And for how to subtract,well you subtract

758
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,270
我们用-rat过程做减法
rationals with minus rat.

759
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,090
然后是乘法和除法
And multiply, and divide.

760
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,640
以上就是让我们的有理数包
And that is exactly and precisely what we have to do

761
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,510
兼容这个通用算术系统的准确严谨的步骤
to fit inside this generic arithmetic system.

762
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,560
那么整个系统怎么工作呢
Well how does the whole thing work?

763
00:49:51,560 --> 00:50:00,170
看 我们想要的是通用操作符
See, what we want to do is have some generic operators.

764
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,720
让add,sub mul和div
Have add and sub and mul and div

765
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,990
变成通用操作符
be generic operators.

766
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:18,930
所以我们要定义add过程 对x和y调用add
So we're going to define add and say, to add x and y, that

767
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,840
就是operate
will be operate--

768
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,490
我们把这个叫做operate-2
we were going to call it operate-2.

769
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,350
这是我们的操作过程 但是要接收两个参数
This is our operator procedure,but set up for two

770
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:37,261
对它们应用add 把它们加起来
arguments using add on x and y.

771
00:50:37,261 --> 00:50:40,420
这是和operate类似的一个东西
And so this is the analog to operate.

772
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,680
我们再看看这个代码
Let's look at the code for second.

773
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,930
它和operate很相似
It's almost like operate.

774
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:51,550
为了使用这个操作符对这两个参数
To operate with some operator on an argument 1 and an

775
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,370
进行操作 我们首先要做的是
argument 2, well the first thing we're going to do is

776
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:01,900
检查这两个参数的类型是不是相同
check and see if the two arguments have the same type.

777
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,610
所以我们要问 第一个参数的类型
So we'll say, is the type of the first argument the same as

778
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,860
和第二个的类型一样吗
the type of the second argument?

779
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:15,070
如果不一样 我们就停止运行 然后抱怨
And if they're not, we'll go off and complain, and say,

780
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:15,670
发生了一个错误
that's an error.

781
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,140
我们不知道怎么对它们进行操作
We don't know how to do that.

782
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,920
如果它们的类型确实是相同的
If they do have the same type, we'll do

783
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,080
我们就和之前做一样的事
exactly what we did before.

784
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,460
我们会查询在参数的类型对应的
We'll go look and filed under the type of the argument--

785
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,420
参数1和参数2是同样的类型 知道一个就可以
arg 1 and arg 2 have the same type, so it doesn't matter.

786
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,640
我们到表格里去查找对应的过程
So we'll look in the table,find the procedure.

787
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,870
如果那里有一个过程 我们就把它应用到
If there is a procedure there,then we'll apply it to the

788
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:43,030
参数1和参数2的内容上去
contents of the argument 1 and the contents of arg 2.

789
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,760
如果是其他情况呢 就报错
And otherwise we'll say, error.

790
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,890
未定义操作符
Undefined operator.

791
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,140
这就是operate-2过程
And so there's operate-2.

792
00:51:51,326 --> 00:51:55,160
这就是我们要做的全部事情
And that's all we have to do.

793
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,640
我们刚刚才写好了一个复数运算包
We just built the complex number package before.

794
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,140
那么怎么把它放进
How do we embed that complex number package in

795
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,140
这个通用系统里面呢
this generic system?

796
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,390
方法几乎是一样的
Almost the same.

797
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:11,060
我们构造一个过程叫做make-complex
We make a procedure called make-complex that takes

798
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,100
它把任何George和Martha给我们的东西
whatever George and Martha hand to us and add the

799
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,350
贴上complex的类型标志
type-complex.

800
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:25,840
然后我们说 要把复数相加 这个+complex过程
And then we say, to add complex numbers, plus complex,

801
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:32,240
我们用我们的内部过程 +c 把结果加上类型
we use our internal procedure,plus c, and attach a type,

802
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,490
让它变成复数类型
make that a complex number.

803
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,840
那么我们的包里原来有+c和*c这两个过程
So our original package had names plus c and minus c that

804
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,250
用来和George和Martha通信
we're using to communicate with George and Martha.

805
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,730
然后为了与外部通信
And then to communicate with the outside world, we have a

806
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:53,380
我们还有+complex和-complex
thing called plus-complex and minus-complex.

807
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,530
等等等等
And so on.

808
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,000
它们唯一的不同就在于
And the only difference is that these return

809
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,120
它们的返回值是被包装好的#TBD
values that are tight.

810
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,850
我们可以在这里看到它们
So they can be looked at up here.

811
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,690
而这些是内部过程
And these are internal operations.

812
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,680
我们再来看那个幻灯片
Let's go look at that slide again.

813
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,740
我们还有一件事要做
There's one more thing we do.

814
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:19,280
在定义了+complex之后 我们把这个过程
After defining plus-complex, we put under the type complex

815
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,200
放在表格中complex类型和add记号的格子里
and the symbol add, that procedure plus complex.

816
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,130
然后类似地 对于减法
And then similarly for subtracting complex numbers,

817
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,130
乘法和除法也做同样的事情
and multiplying them,and dividing them.

818
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,250
那我们怎么安装普通的数字呢
OK, how do we install ordinary numbers?

819
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,160
方法还是一样的
Exactly the same way.

820
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,750
我们会写一个叫做make-number的过程
Come off and say, well we'll make a thing called make-number

821
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,500
Make-number接收一个数 然后给它加上类型
Make-number takes a number and attaches a type, which is the

822
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,260
number类型标志
symbol number.

823
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,300
我们构造一个过程叫做+number 它单纯地
We build a procedure called plus-number, which is simply,

824
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,220
用lisp自带的加法把两个数加起来
add the two things using the ordinary addition, because in

825
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,850
因为现在说的是普通的数字 然后
this case we're talking about ordinary numbers, and attach a

826
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,510
给它附加类型 让它变成number类型
type to it and make that a number.

827
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,700
然后我们把+number过程放到
And then we put into the table under the symbol number and

828
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,550
表格里number和add对应的的格子中
the operation add, this procedure plus-number, and

829
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,360
再用相同的方法把减法 乘法
then the same thing for subtracting, and multiplying,

830
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,610
除法也放进去
and dividing.

831
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,060
我们举一个例子 就看得清楚一点
Let's look at an example,just to make it clear.

832
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:32,600
假设 比如说
Suppose, for instance,I'm going

833
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,150
我要执行这个操作
to perform the operation.

834
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:38,220
好，现在我要执行一个操作
So I sit up here and I'm going to perform the operation,

835
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,930
比如说我把两个复数乘起来
which looks like multiplying two complex numbers.

836
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:49,786
把3+4i和2+6i 乘起来
So I would multiply, say,3 plus 4i and 2 plus 6i.

837
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,740
这就是我调用mul过程
And that's something that I might want to take

838
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,840
要传入的参数
hand that to mul.

839
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,170
这里就代表通用操作符mul
I'll write mul as my generic operator here.

840
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,280
那么它怎么工作呢
How's that going to work?

841
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:05,020
我们讲3+4i 在整个系统里
Well 3 plus 4i, say, sits in the system at this level as

842
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,250
处于这样的一个位置
something that looks like this.

843
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,280
它是George的那种复数
Let's say it was one of George's.

844
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,695
所以它的内部有一个3和一个4
So it would have a 3 and a 4.

845
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:25,330
这上面还贴着George的类型标志
And attached to that would be George's type, which would say

846
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:29,510
是他构造的rectangular类型
rectangular, it came from George.

847
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,230
又附加在那上面的
And attached to that--

848
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,630
从更上一层的视角来看这一段数据
and this itself would be the data view from the next level up

849
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,700
它又是一个
which it is--

850
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,030
整个这个东西又是一个complex类型的数据
so that itself would be a type-data object which would

851
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,280
整个这个东西又是一个complex类型的数据
say complex.

852
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,240
那么这就是这个对象
So that's what this object would look like up here at the

853
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,300
在最高层视角中的样子 在那些通用操作
very highest level, where the really super-generic

854
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,560
视角上的样子
operations are looking at it.

855
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,720
现在 mul过程会过来问
Now what happens, mul eventually's going to come along

856
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,400
哦 它的类型是什么
and say, oh,what's it's type?

857
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,650
它的类型是complex
It's type is complex.

858
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:08,460
然后运行到operate-2 然后说
Go through to operate-2 and say, oh, what I want to do is

859
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,440
啊 我想要把表格里的过程
apply what's in the table,which is going to be the

860
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:17,150
*complex这个过程 应用到它的
procedure star complex, on this thing with the type

861
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:17,950
类型剥下来之后的东西上面
stripped off.

862
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,400
所以它会把类型剥下来
So it's going to strip off the type, take that much, and send

863
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,288
把剩下的东西传递给复数的世界
that down into the complex world.

864
00:56:26,288 --> 00:56:28,950
复数的世界看了看它有的操作然后说
The complex world looks at its operations and says, oh, I

865
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,280
我得调用*c这个过程
have to apply star c.

866
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,490
然后*c过程说 我要看看这个东西里面
Star c might say, oh, at some point I want to look at the

867
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:39,420
保存的模 这个数据是多少
magnitude of this object that it's in, that it's got.

868
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,160
然后它们会说 啊
And they'll say, oh, it's

869
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,870
它是直角坐标表示的 是George的东西
rectangular, it's one of George's.

870
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:47,340
所以它们又剥掉了一个类型
So it'll then strip off the next version of type, and hand

871
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,160
然后把内容交给George 让他提取出它的模值
that down to George to take the magnitude of.

872
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,290
那么我们看到这其中
So you see what's going on is that there are

873
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:59,320
有一个类型的链条
these chains of types.

874
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,530
这个链条的长度就是你要
And the length of the chain is sort of the number of levels

875
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:05,090
在这个表格里上升的层数
that you're going to be going up in this table.

876
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:09,590
类型的作用是 每次我们
And what a type tells you, every time you have a vertical

877
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,350
在这个表格里加一道垂直的抽象屏障
barrier in this table, where there's some ambiguity about

878
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:15,010
你不知道要去下一层的哪个位置的时候
where you should go down to the next level, the type is

879
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,440
类型就会给你指路
telling you where to go.

880
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,950
然后最底层的过程 它们构造数据结构
And then everybody at the bottom, as they construct data

881
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,810
对数据进行筛选之后 再把类型贴回去
and filter it up, they stick their type back on.

882
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:30,750
这就是整个系统的总体结构
So that's the general structure of the system.

883
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,820
好
OK.

884
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,660
明白了这个之后 我们再让这个系统
Now that we've got this, let's go and make this thing even

885
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,910
变得更加复杂
more complex.

886
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:46,150
我们这次不光要在系统里
Let's talk about adding to the system not only these kinds of

887
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:49,680
添加新的类型的数字 我们讨论一下
numbers, but it's also meaningful to start talking

888
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,510
怎么把多项式也加进去
about adding polynomials.

889
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,360
让它能对多项式做运算
Might do arithmetic on polynomials.

890
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,570
比如我们可以计算
Like we could have x to the fifteenth plus 2x to the

891
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:04,480
x^15+2x^7+5
seventh plus 5.

892
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,380
像这样的多项式
That might be some polynomial.

893
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,720
如果有两个这样的东西 我们最后可以把它们
And if we have two such gadgets we can add them or

894
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,530
相加或者相乘
multiply them.

895
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,140
我们先不要担心相除的问题
Let's not worry about dividing them.

896
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,870
只考虑相加相乘和相减
Just add them, multiply them,then we'll subtract them.

897
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,160
我们需要做什么
What do we have to do? Well

898
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,830
我们先来想想怎么表示一个多项式
let's think about how we might represent a polynomial.

899
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,950
它也是一种带类型的数据
It's going to be some typed data object.

900
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:29,690
这个系统里的一个多项式应该是一个
So let's say a polynomial to this system might look like a

901
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,000
polynomial类型的对象
thing that starts with the type polynomial.

902
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,710
接下来它可能要问这个多项式的
And then maybe it says the next thing is what

903
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,550
变量是哪个
variable its in.

904
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,960
我说我是一个以x为变量的多项式
So I might say I'm a polynomial in the variable x.

905
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,500
然后它里面要有这个多项式的
And then it'll have some information about

906
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,250
各个项的信息
what the terms are.

907
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,620
有很多种方法
And there're just tons of ways to do this, but one way is to

908
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:51,520
我们采用的方法是构造一个项表
say we're going to have a thing called a term-list. And

909
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,700
一个项表
a term-list--

910
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,830
在这个例子里我们用的是
well, in our case we'll use something

911
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,360
类似这样的东西
that looks like this.

912
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,680
我们把它写成一系列按系数排列的序对
We'll make it a bunch of pairs which have an order in a coefficient

913
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:09,070
那么这个项表就能表示这个多项式了
So this polynomial would be represented by this term-list.

914
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:12,910
它的意义是这个多项式
And what that means is that this polynomial starts off

915
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:19,710
第一项的次数是15，系数是1
with a term of order 15 and coefficient 1.

916
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,780
然后下一项的次数是7
And the next thing in it is a term of order 7 and

917
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,680
系数是2 再下一项是一个常数 次数是0
coefficient 2, a term of order 0, which is constant in

918
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,450
系数是5
coefficient 5.

919
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:35,600
实际上有很多很多种方法
And there are lots and lots of ways, and lots and lots of

920
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,890
期间又需要无数次的权衡#TBD 来构造这个代数操作
trade-offs when you really think about making algebraic

921
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,570
程序包或者准确地说
manipulation packages about exactly how you should

922
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,730
来设计数据的表示方法
represent these things.

923
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,180
但是我们这种是比较标准的一种
But this is a fairly standard one.

924
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,770
它适用于很多情况
It's useful in a lot of contexts.

925
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:51,815
好 那么我们怎么实现我们的多项式算术呢
OK, well how do we implement our polynomial arithmetic?

926
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:55,520
现在开始着手做这个事情
Let's start out.

927
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,760
构造一个多项式 首先要
What we'll do to make a polynomial--

928
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,690
首先我们得找一个办法来构造多项式
we'll first have a way to make polynomials.

929
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:08,560
我们可以用一个变量 比如x
We're going to make a polynomial out of variable

930
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,180
和一个项表来构造它们 然后我们要用某种方法
like x and term-list. And all that does is we'll package

931
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,990
把它们包装起来
them together someway.We'll

932
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,740
我们要把变量和项表组合起来
put the variable together with the term list

933
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,380
我们可以用cons，然后把这个序对加上polynomial的类型标志
using cons, and then attached to that the type polynomial.

934
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,280
那我们怎么把两个多项式相加呢
OK, how do we add two polynomials?

935
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,330
要相加两个多项式 p1和p2
To add a polynomial, p1 and p2, and then just for

936
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,060
为了简化问题假设我们只相加
simplicity let's say we will only add

937
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,380
变量相同的两个式子
things in the same variable.

938
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,740
那么如果它们的变量相同
So if they have the same variable, and same variable

939
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,160
是否相同交给这个选择函数判断
here is going to be some selector we write, whose

940
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,150
我们不必在意它的细节
details we don't care about.

941
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,280
如果两个多项式的变量相同
If the two polynomials have the same variable, then we'll

942
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:48,810
我们就继续运算
do something.

943
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:52,350
如果它们的变量不相同 我们返回一个错误
If they don't have the same variable, we'll give an error,

944
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,480
两个多项式的变量不相同
polynomials not in the same variable.

945
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,120
如果它们的变量确实是相同的呢
And if they do have the same variable, what we'll do is

946
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,130
我们要做的是构造一个新的多项式
we'll make a polynomial whose variable is whatever that

947
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,570
它的变量是原来两个式子的变量 它的项表
variable is, and whose term-list is something we'll

948
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:10,170
我们用这个+terms过程 +terms会把两个项表加起来
call sum-terms. Plus terms will add the two term lists.

949
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,500
所以我们要把两个多项式的项表加起来
So we'll add the two term lists to the polynomial.

950
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,755
得到一个新的项表 我们把它们加起来
That'll give us a term-list.We'll add on, we'll say it's a

951
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:19,500
我们说这是一个关于这个变量的
polynomial in the variable with that

952
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,550
有这么一个项表的多项式 这就是+poly过程
term-list. That's plus poly.

953
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:26,360
然后我们要把这个过程放进表格中polynomial
And then we're going to put in our table under the type

954
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,520
那一栏的下面 用+poly实现add操作
polynomial, add them using plus poly.

955
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,750
当然实际上没做多少事情
And of course we really haven't done much.

956
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,360
我们只是把所有的工作压到
What we've really done is pushed all the work onto this

957
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,480
+terms的头上 它会负责把项表相加起来
thing, plus-terms, which is supposed to add term-lists.

958
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,920
我们看看这个过程
Let's look at that.

959
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:48,900
这是我们把两个项表相加的大概过程
Here's an overview of how we might add two term-lists.

960
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,860
L1和L2是两个项表
So L1 and L2 were going to be two term-lists.

961
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,700
然后每个项表都是一系列序对 按次数排序
And a term-list is a bunch of pairs, coefficient in order.

962
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,950
这里有一个大的条件判断
And it's a big case analysis.

963
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:03,470
我们要做的第一件事是看看项表里
And the first thing we'll check for and see if there are

964
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:07,020
有没有至少一个项 我们在项表里递归下降
any terms. We're going to recursively work down these

965
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,980
最终下降到一个状态就是L1
term-lists, so eventually we'll get to a place where

966
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,270
或者L2 有一个是空的
either L1 or L2 might be empty.

967
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,160
如果其中一个是空的呢 我们的答案就是
And if either one is empty,our answer will

968
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:15,850
剩下的另一个
be the other one.

969
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:20,720
就是说如果L1是空表 我们就返回L2
So if L1 is empty we'll return L2, and if L2 is empty

970
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,470
L2是空表的话就返回L1
we'll return L1.

971
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:27,220
除此之外还有三种情况
Otherwise there are sort of three interesting cases.

972
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,560
我们先拿到每一个项表里的
What we're going to do is grab the first term in each of

973
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:37,660
第一项 我们把它们分别叫做t1和t2
those lists, called t1 and t2.

974
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:43,090
我们看t1的次数是高于
And we're going to look at three cases, depending on

975
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:47,230
还是低于t2的次数 还是相等 我们看属于
whether the order of t1 is greater than the order of t2,

976
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:51,470
这三种情况中的哪一种
or less than t2, or the same.

977
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:54,910
这就是我们要判断的三种情况
Those are the three cases we're going to look at.

978
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,160
先看看这一种
Let's look at this case.

979
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:03,550
如果t1的次数比t2的次数要高
If the order of t1 is greater than the order of t2, then

980
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:08,280
就意味着我们的答案的第一项的次数
what that means is that our answer is going to start with

981
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,480
就是t1的次数
this term of the order of t1.

982
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,455
因为高次项不会和任何次数低的项相加
Because it won't combine with any lower order terms. So what

983
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:19,720
那么我们只需要把低次的项加起来 我们递归地
we do is add the lower order terms. We recursively add

984
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,900
把L1和L2两个项表里
together all the terms in the rest of the

985
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,880
剩下的项相加
term-list in L1 and L2.

986
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,120
作为我们的答案中低次的项
That's going to be the lower order terms of the answer.

987
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,490
然后我们把它们
And then we're going to adjoin to that the

988
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:33,180
和最高次的项连接起来
highest order term.

989
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,120
这里我用了一系列
And I'm using here a whole bunch of procedures I haven't

990
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,360
我还没有定义过的过程 比如adjoin-term rest-terms
defined, like a adjoin-term, and rest-terms, and selectors

991
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,410
还有获取次数的选择函数
that get order.

992
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:44,730
但是你可以想象它们是什么样子的
But you can imagine what those are.

993
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:48,550
那么如果第一个项表的次数比第二个要高
So if the first term-list has a higher order than the

994
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:51,830
我们就递归地把所有的低次的项相加
second, we recursively add all the lower terms and then stick

995
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:55,540
再和最高次项连接起来
on that last term.

996
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,890
对于其他情况也是一样的
The other case, the same way.

997
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:02,400
如果第一个多项式次数比较低
If the first term has a smaller order, well then we add

998
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,740
我们就把整个第一个多项式 和第二个多项式低次的项
we add the first term-list and the rest of the terms in the

999
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:12,430
相加 然后把结果再和最高次项连起来
second one, and adjoin on this highest order term.

1000
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,660
到现在没发生多少复杂的事情 我们只是一次次
So so far nothing's much happened, we've just sort of

1001
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,700
把问题变成 让低次数的项相加
pushed this thing off into adding lower order terms. The

1002
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,870
还有最后一种情况是 两个多项式的次数一样
last case where you actually get to a coefficients that you

1003
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,240
你必须要把它们的系数加起来
have to add, this will be the case where

1004
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,240
你必须要把它们的系数加起来
the orders are equal.

1005
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,340
我们的应对方法是 仍然是递归地
What we do is, well again recursively add the lower

1006
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,460
把低次的项相加 但是现在必须要实实在在地相加两个东西了
order terms. But now we have to really combine something.

1007
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:38,960
我们构造一个项 让它的次数等于
What we do is we make a term whose order is the order of

1008
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,820
我们正在处理的那一项的次数
the term we're looking at.

1009
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,320
因为现在t1和t2的次数是相同的
By now t1 and t2 have the same order.

1010
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,090
这就是它们的次数
That's its order.

1011
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:50,400
它的系数呢 通过把t1和t2
And its coefficient is gotten by adding the coefficient of

1012
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,230
的系数相加来获取
t1 and the coefficient of t2.

1013
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,800
这是一个庞大的递归过程
This is a big recursive working down of terms, but

1014
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,070
但是实际上整个过程中只有一个符号是
really there's only one interesting symbol in this

1015
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:05,900
最有意思的 只有一个有趣的想法
procedure, only one interesting idea.

1016
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,500
那就是这个add
The interesting idea is this add.

1017
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:15,330
说它有趣是因为
And the reason that's interesting is because

1018
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,220
刚才有一件好事发生
something completely wonderful just happened.

1019
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:25,440
我们把多项式加法 没有归为plus过程的一种
We reduced adding polynomials,not to sort of plus, but to

1020
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,820
却把它放在通用操作符add之下
the generic add.

1021
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:33,270
换句话说 用这种方法实现它之后
In other words, by implementing it that way, not

1022
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:37,530
我们的系统就不光有
only do we have our system where we can have rational

1023
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:42,090
有理数，复数和普通数字的运算这些功能
numbers, or complex numbers,or ordinary numbers, we've

1024
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,340
我们同时也让它支持多项式运算了
just added on polynomials.

1025
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,820
但是这个多项式的系数可以是
But the coefficients of the polynomials can be anything

1026
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,590
这个系统能够相加的任何东西
that the system can add.

1027
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:57,450
也就是说 多项式的系数可以是
So these could be polynomials whose coefficients are

1028
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:04,110
有理数或者复数 复数可以是
rational numbers or complex numbers, which in turn could

1029
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:11,250
直角坐标或者极坐标表示 或者就是普通的数值
be either rectangular, or polar, or ordinary numbers.

1030
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:23,460
我想说的是 我们的系统现在可以
So what I mean precisely is our system right now

1031
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:30,200
自动处理多项式相加这样的事情
automatically can handle things like adding together

1032
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:35,830
比如2/3x^2+5/17x+11/4这样的式子
polynomials that have this one:2/3 of x squared plus

1033
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:40,940
比如2/3x^2+5/17x+11/4这样的式子
5/17 x plus 11/4.

1034
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,210
也可以自动处理像是
Or automatically handle polynomials that look like 3

1035
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:54,160
(3+2i)x^5+4+7i这样的式子
plus 2i times x to the fifth plus 4 plus 7i, or something.

1036
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,210
系统可以自动处理这些运算
You can automatically handle those things.

1037
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,820
为什么
Why is that?

1038
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:03,280
仅仅是因为 或者说深层次的原因是
That's merely because, or profoundly because we reduced

1039
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,790
我们把多项式相加归约成了把它们的系数相加
adding polynomials to adding their coefficients.

1040
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,670
而系数的相加是由add通用操作符
And adding coefficients was done by the generic add

1041
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,770
来完成的 它说我不管你的数据类型是什么
operator, which said, I don't care what your types are

1042
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:15,170
只要我能够处理就行
as long as I know how to add you.

1043
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:17,800
于是我们就免费获得了
So automatically for free we get the

1044
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,880
处理这些东西的功能
ability to handle that.

1045
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,920
更神奇的事情是 还记得吧
What's even better than that,because remember one of the

1046
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,870
我们把多项式加法 +poly过程
things we did is we put into the table that the way you add

1047
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:34,660
放进了表格里
polynomials is using plus poly.

1048
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,480
这意味着多项式本身也已经是
That means that polynomials themselves are

1049
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,370
通用操作add可以操作的东西了
things that can be added.

1050
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,110
比如说 我写一个例子
So for instance let me write one here.

1051
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,510
这是一个多项式
Here's a polynomial.

1052
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,080
我正在写的这个东西
So this gadget here I'm writing up, this is a

1053
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:02,710
它是一个以y作为变量的多项式 而它的系数是
polynomial in y whose coefficients are

1054
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,690
以x作为变量的多项式
polynomials in x.

1055
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:13,110
那么你看到 “多项式能被add过程相加”
So you see, simply by saying, polynomials are themselves

1056
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,590
只要这一事实成立 我们就可以说
things that can be added, we can go off and say, well not

1057
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:19,560
我们的系统现在不光能运算有理数 复数
only can we deal with rationals,or complex, or

1058
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,330
普通的数字 如果一个多项式它的系数
ordinary numbers, but we can deal with polynomials whose

1059
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:25,420
是有理数，复数，普通数字
coefficients are rationals, or complex, or ordinary numbers,

1060
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:31,979
或者这个系数是一个多项式 它的系数是有理数
or polynomials whose coefficients are rationals, or

1061
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:37,569
各种复数 普通数字
complex, rectangular, polar,or ordinary numbers, or

1062
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:42,609
或者又一个多项式 系数是有理数，
polynomials whose coefficients are rationals, complex, or

1063
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:43,670
复数，普通数字
ordinary numbers.

1064
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:45,950
以此类推
And so on, and so on, and so on.

1065
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:50,830
我们构造出了一座无限延伸的 递归的
So this is sort of an infinite or maybe a recursive tower of

1066
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:53,880
类型的高塔
types that we've built up.

1067
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,920
这一切都来源于那个小小的记号 ADD
And it's all exactly from that one little symbol, A-D-D.

1068
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,615
来源于在多项式程序里
Writing "add" instead of "plus" in

1069
01:08:59,615 --> 01:09:02,270
用"add"来代替"+"
the polynomial thing.

1070
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,620
换一种方式来理解它就是
Slightly different way to think about it is that

1071
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:08,740
多项式是构造类型的函数
polynomials are a constructor for types.

1072
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:12,149
也就是说你传递给它一个类型 比如整数类型
Namely you give it a type, like integer, and it returns

1073
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:16,279
然后它就返回一个以整数作为系数的多项式
for you polynomials in x whose coefficients are integers.

1074
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:20,010
过程中很重要的一点是对多项式的操作
And the important thing about that is that the operations on

1075
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,729
被归约成了对系数的操作
polynomials reduce to the operations on the

1076
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:23,500
被归约成了对系数的操作
coefficients.

1077
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,840
有很多地方都用到了这种思想#TBD
And there are a lot of things like that.

1078
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,870
作为一个例子 我们再回头看看有理数
So for example, let's go back and rational numbers.

1079
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:32,410
之前我们把有理数看成 上面有一个整数
We thought about rational numbers as an integer over an

1080
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:34,229
下面有一个整数 这样的东西 但是
integer, but there's the general notion

1081
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:36,240
所有有理对象都可以这样来表示
of a rational object.

1082
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:43,010
比如我们也可以把3x+7放在上面 x^2+1放在下面
Like we might think about 3x plus 7 over x squared plus 1.

1083
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:47,430
这是一个分子分母都是多项式的
That's general rational object whose numerator and

1084
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,310
广义上的有理式
denominator are polynomials.

1085
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:52,990
有理式相加 和有理数相加一样
And to add two of them we use the same formula, numerator

1086
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:55,720
左边分子乘右边分母加上右边分子乘左边分母 写在上面
times denominator plus denominator times numerator

1087
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,290
两个分母的乘积写在下面
over product of denominators.

1088
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,530
怎么把它放到我们的系统中
How could we install that in our system?

1089
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,820
这是我们原来的
Well here's our original rational

1090
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:04,250
有理数算术程序包
number arithmetic package.

1091
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,660
为了让这个系统能够
And all we have to do in order to make the entire system

1092
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,530
支持有理式的运算 我们把这些
continue working with general rational objects, is replace

1093
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:16,480
特定的加法和乘法过程 都改成通用操作符
these particular pluses and stars by the generic operator.

1094
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,870
所以如果我们把原来那个过程变成这个过程
So if we simply change that procedure to this one, here

1095
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:23,100
把+和*换成add和mul
we've changed plus and star to add a mul, those are

1096
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:28,170
是唯一的改动 然后霎时间我们的整个系统
absolutely the only change,then suddenly our entire

1097
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:34,000
都知道怎么运算这样的东西了
system can start talking about objects that look like this.

1098
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,350
比如说 这里的这个有理式
So for example, here is a rational object whose

1099
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:44,030
它的分子是一个关于x的 系数是有理数的多项式
numerator is a polynomial in x whose coefficients are

1100
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:47,350
它的分子是一个关于x的 系数是有理数的多项式
rational numbers.

1101
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:54,000
或者有一个有理式 它的分子是关于x的多项式
Or here is a rational object whose numerator is polynomials in x

1102
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,480
多项式的系数又是有理式
whose coefficients are rational objects constructed

1103
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,390
有理式又由复数组成
out of complex numbers.

1104
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,850
或者别的像这样的东西
And then there are a lot of other things like that.

1105
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,500
看，只要操作能够归约成
See, whenever you have a thing where the operations reduce to

1106
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,450
更小的操作 另一个例子是比如有一个
operations on the pieces,another example would be two

1107
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,310
2*2的矩阵
by two matrices.

1108
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:17,030
假如有这样一个矩阵形式的东西
I have the idea, there might be a matrix here of general

1109
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,650
不管它里面是什么
things that I don't care about.

1110
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:25,180
但是如果我对两个这种东西调用add 答案就是
But if I add two of them, the answer over here is gotten by

1111
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,030
把一个和另一个相加的结果 不管它们是怎么相加的
adding this one and that one,however they like to add.

1112
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:31,110
那么我可以用同样的方法实现
So I can implement that the same way.

1113
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,520
如果我这么做了 又一次 霎时间我的整个系统
And if I do that, then again suddenly my system can start

1114
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,480
就可以处理像这样的东西了
handling things like this.

1115
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,460
比如说一个矩阵 它的元素都是
So here's a matrix whose elements happen to be--

1116
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,330
它的元素是一个有理式
we'll say this element here is a rational object whose

1117
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:47,230
这个有理式的分子分母都是多项式
numerator and denominators are polynomials.

1118
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:50,510
我们免费获得了这样的功能
And all that comes for free.

1119
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,920
整个过程中发生了什么
What's really going on here?

1120
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,910
就是摆脱了这个坐在这里
What's really going on is getting rid of this manager

1121
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:02,060
想要对别人的所有事情都插一手的
who's sitting there poking his nose into who everybody's

1122
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,120
这个经理
business is.

1123
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,900
我们构造了一个 控制去中心化 的系统
We built a system that has decentralized control.

1124
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:18,340
你进入这个系统的时候 不会有人一边闲逛一边说#TBD
So when you come into and no one's poking around saying,

1125
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,080
我看看官方的相加对象列表里面
gee, are you in the official list of

1126
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,440
有没有你
people who can be added?

1127
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,850
你直接就可以用正确的方法
Rather you say, well go off and add yourself how your

1128
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:27,810
把你和别的东西加起来
parts like to be added.

1129
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:31,030
这么做的好处就是 就连这种非常非常
And the result of that is you can get this very, very, very

1130
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,870
复杂的分层对象也可以被分解后#TBD
complex hierarchy where a lot of things just get done and

1131
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,482
自动放到正确的地方去处理
rooted to the right place automatically.

1132
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:38,732
讲课就讲到这里 下面大家提问
Let's stop for questions.

1133
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:43,020
你说你免费获得了这些功能
AUDIENCE: You say you get this for free.

1134
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,920
但是我在意的是你现在丢掉了一种
One thing that strikes me is that now you've lost kind of

1135
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,150
什么在上层、什么在下层的
the cleanness of the break between what's on top and

1136
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:50,910
清楚的界限
what's underneath.

1137
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:52,770
或者说 现在你是在用
In other words, now you're defining some of the

1138
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:54,850
上层的东西来定义
lower-level procedures in terms of things

1139
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:56,610
下层的过程
above their own line.

1140
01:12:56,610 --> 01:13:00,350
这不是很危险吗
Isn't that dangerous?

1141
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:05,440
或者说 我能想到的还有 结构会变得混乱
Or, if nothing more, a little less structured?

1142
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,125
教授：不 我——
PROFESSOR: No, I--

1143
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:07,770
你问它的结构混不混乱
the question is whether that's less structured.

1144
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:08,690
这要看你说的“结构”是指什么
Depends on what you mean by structure.

1145
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:11,050
整个过程里我们都在做递归
All this is doing is recursion.

1146
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:15,780
看 就是说要把这些东西相加
See, it's saying that the way you add these

1147
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,840
就要用到这个过程
guys is to use that.

1148
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,520
这不是结构混乱
And that's not less structured,it's just a

1149
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,610
递归的结构就是这样的
recursive structure.

1150
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,990
所以我不认为它不清楚
So I don't think it's particularly any less clean.

1151
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:27,250
学生：那么你想对乘法或者加法操作
AUDIENCE: Now when you want to change the multiplier or the

1152
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:31,380
做出修改的时候 可能会导致
add operator, suddenly you've got tremendous consequences

1153
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,480
程度无法预测的灾难性后果 #TBD
underneath that you're not even sure the extent of.

1154
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,080
教授：你说得对 但是那要看你的意思是什么
PROFESSOR: That's right, but it depends what you mean.

1155
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,470
从两个角度来讨论#TBD
See, this goes both ways.

1156
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,690
举个什么例子好呢
What would be a good example?

1157
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:47,500
比如说 之前我忽略了通用除法操作
I ignored greatest common divisor, for instance.

1158
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,280
我忽略了这个问题 是为了简化我们的例子
I ignored that problem just to keep the example simple.

1159
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:59,820
但是如果突然我觉得 有理数加法应该对结果
But if I suddenly decided that plus rat here should do a GCD

1160
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:04,750
求最大公约数 并且把这个功能安装到程序里 那么这个功能
computation and install that,then that immediately becomes

1161
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:08,280
一旦安装 就立刻可以被所有过程调用
available to all of these, to that guy, and that guy, and

1162
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,560
被这个或者那个 所有的这些
that guy, and all the way down.

1163
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,890
所以这个取决于你为什么要提高耦合性
So it depends what you mean by the coherence of your system.

1164
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,030
确实你可能想设计一个
It's certainly true that you might want to have a special

1165
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,950
不这样递归下降的程序
different one that didn't filter down through the

1166
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,400
但是我举这个例子的好处
coefficients, but the nice thing about this particular

1167
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,440
就在于我们通常都是这么做的
example is that mostly you do.

1168
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,630
学生：是不是有一个问题 我想
AUDIENCE: Isn't that the problem, I think, that you're

1169
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,950
就是你会被这个结构捆绑起来
getting to tied in with the fact that the structuring, the

1170
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:36,330
这个递归的结构是实际上被执行了的
recursiveness of that structuring there is actually

1171
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:40,340
而不是仅仅是为了定义类型的需要
in execution as opposed to just definition of the actual

1172
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:41,590
被这个事实所束缚
types themselves?

1173
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,120
教授：我想我明白你的意思
PROFESSOR: I think I understand the question.

1174
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,650
你是想说在这个系统投入运行之后
The point is that these types evolve and get more and more

1175
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,400
这些类型还会变得越来越复杂
complex as the thing's actually running.

1176
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:50,730
你是不是想……
Is that what--

1177
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:50,990
学生：对
AUDIENCE: Yes.
你是不是想……
Is that what--

1178
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:51,790
在它投入运行之后
As it's running.

1179
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:51,956
教授：……说这个？
PROFESSOR: --what you're saying?

1180
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:52,090
对 重点就在于……
Yes, the point is--

1181
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:54,180
学生：而不是作为基本的定义
AUDIENCE: As opposed to the basic definitions.
对 重点就在于……
Yes, the point is--

1182
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:54,830
教授：对
PROFESSOR: Right.

1183
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,210
我们的类型结构可以说就是递归的
The type structure is sort of recursive.

1184
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:02,770
它并不是一个 可以在系统投入运行之前
It's not that you can make this finite list of the actual

1185
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,850
就能把要用到的东西全部包括的列表
things they might look like before the system runs.

1186
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,780
它是一个会发展变化的东西
It's something that evolves.

1187
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,610
所以如果你想要定制这个系统#TBD
So if you want to specify that system, you have to do in some

1188
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:12,275
你就不能通过修改这个列表 而是要通过其它的方式
other way than by this finite list. You have to do it by a

1189
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:13,670
你需要用一个递归结构实现它
recursive structure.

1190
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,960
学生：因为类型的基本结构
AUDIENCE: Because the basic structure of the types is

1191
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,900
是非常简单的
pretty clean and simple.

1192
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,125
教授：对
PROFESSOR: Right.

1193
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:21,460
嗯？
Yes?

1194
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,870
学生：我有一个问题
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

1195
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:25,980
我明白一旦你的数据结构被设计好之后
I understand once you have your data structure set up,

1196
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,230
它是怎么把complex标志拿掉 把它传递给下层
how it pulls off complex and passes that down, and then

1197
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,640
然后把rect标志拿掉 再传递给下层
pulls off rect, passes that down.

1198
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,790
但是如果你只是一个用户 对这些
But if you're just a user and you don't know anything about

1199
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,610
rect或者polar这些类型完全不懂 你怎么知道去
rect or polar or whatever, how do you initially set up that

1200
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:37,330
设置这个数据结构
data structure so that everything goes

1201
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,390
让所有东西正常运转呢
to the right spot?

1202
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:41,210
如果我只知道左边的这个算式
If I just have the equation over there on the left and I

1203
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,500
我只是想把复数加起来或者乘起来
just want to add, multiply complex numbers--

1204
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,640
教授：这就是它神奇的地方
PROFESSOR: Well that's the wonderful thing.

1205
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,730
如果你是一个用户 直接调用mul就可以了
If you're just a user you say "mul."

1206
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,280
学生：然后它就能明白我要计算的是复数？
AUDIENCE: And it figures out that I mean complex numbers?

1207
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,420
或者我怎么告诉它我想——
Or how do I tell it that I want--

1208
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:51,950
教授：然后你就会得到一个复数
PROFESSOR: Well you're going to have in your

1209
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,050
教授：然后你就会得到一个复数
hands complex numbers.

1210
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:56,490
看看这个系统 在用户这一级别上还有什么东西
See what you would have at some level, as a real user, is

1211
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,370
我们有一个复数的构造函数
a constructor for complex numbers.

1212
01:15:58,370 --> 01:15:59,470
学生：那么我需要自己构造复数了？
AUDIENCE: So then I have to make complex numbers?

1213
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,350
教授：那么你需要自己构造它们
PROFESSOR: So you have to make them.

1214
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:03,180
作为用户你拥有的 可能是输入界面
What you would probably have as a user is some little thing

1215
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:07,390
内置的小功能 它会提供给你输入复数的方法
in the reader loop, which would give you some plausible

1216
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,850
内置的小功能 它会提供给你输入复数的方法
way to type in a complex number, in

1217
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:11,590
让你用你喜欢的格式输入
whatever format you like.

1218
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:14,360
也可能你根本就不用输入它们
Or it might be that you're never typing them in.

1219
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,170
只是别人给你一个复数让你计算
Someone's just handing you a complex number.

1220
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:19,500
学生：好 那么如果我有一个复数
AUDIENCE: OK, so if I had a complex number that had a

1221
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,505
它里面有一个多项式 我就要先构造这个多项式
polynomial in it, I'd have to make my polynomial and then

1222
01:16:21,505 --> 01:16:21,960
然后再构造我的复数
make my complex number.

1223
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,220
如果你是从零开始构造它的话 是这样的
PROFESSOR: Right if you wanted it constructed from scratch.

1224
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,710
可以说你是在从零开始构造
At some point you construct them from scratch.

1225
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:27,880
但是你不需要知道（计算的原理） 你有了要计算的东西
But what you don't have to know of that is when you have

1226
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:32,345
可以直接调用mul操作 然后它们就会被乘起来
the object you can just say "mul." And it'll multiply.

1227
01:16:32,345 --> 01:16:33,279
说吧
Yeah?

1228
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:36,450
学生：我想提一个问题 就是……
AUDIENCE: I think the question that was being posed here is,

1229
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:40,220
比如说我想修改我的复数表示方法
say if I want to change my presentation of complexes, or

1230
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:46,330
或者对复数的某些操作 我需要实际上去面对
some operation of complex, how much real code I will have to

1231
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:49,860
或者修改的代码有多少
gets around with, or change to change it in

1232
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,270
在我修改一个操作的过程当中
one specific operation?

1233
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:53,490
教授：看你想要修改的是什么
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE] what you have to change.

1234
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:54,990
重点在于你只需要改
And the point is that you only have to change

1235
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,070
你想改的那一部分
what you're changing.

1236
01:16:56,070 --> 01:17:00,320
想象一下如果Martha决定她
See if Martha decides that she would rather--

1237
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,440
举个简单的例子
let's see something silly--

1238
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,040
比如把序对中两个数的顺序调换
like change the order in the pair.

1239
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:09,700
把模和辐角的顺序反过来
Like angle and magnitude in the other order, she just

1240
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,970
只是这样修改了她自己的程序
makes that change locally.

1241
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:12,750
那么这个改动会准确无误地
And the whole thing will propagate through the system

1242
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,790
扩散到整个系统里
in the right way.

1243
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,040
或者突然你说 我有另一种方法
Or if suddenly you said, gee, I have another representation

1244
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,700
来表示有理数
for rationals.

1245
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,740
我要通过在表格里添加操作
And I'm going to stick it here, by filing those

1246
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,820
把这种方法放到系统里面
operations in the table.

1247
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:27,220
那么突然之间所有的多项式
Then suddenly all of these polynomials whose coefficients

1248
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,240
它们的系数和系数的系数 或者什么东西
are coefficients of coefficients, or whatever,

1249
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,970
都自动支持用这种表示方法来表示了
also can automatically have available that representation.

1250
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,952
这就是我们这种设计的威力
That's the power of this particular one.

1251
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,625
学生：我不知道我能不能提一个
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if I can even pose an intelligent

1252
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:38,700
聪明一点的问题
sounding question.

1253
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:42,920
整个这个系统看起来
But somehow this whole thing went really nicely to this

1254
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,910
非常完美 所有的东西都
beautiful finish where all the things seemed

1255
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,280
各就各位
to fall into place.

1256
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,530
完美得有点不自然
Sort of seemed a little contrived.

1257
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,670
我相信 这都是为了教学方便
That's all for the sake,I'm sure, of teaching.

1258
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,100
我怀疑的是首先发明了这种做法的人
I doubt that the guys who first did this--

1259
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,510
我可能说得不对
and I could be wrong--

1260
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,200
难道一下子就搞清楚了所有这些东西
figured it all out so that when they just all put it all

1261
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,410
只要把这些放在一起 你就突然可以什么什么
together, you could all of the sudden, blam, do any kind of

1262
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,860
对各种对象做各种运算
arithmetic on any kind of object.

1263
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,930
我觉得他们应该研究了很长时间
It seems like maybe they had to play with it for a while

1264
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:11,800
不断地推倒重来
and had to bash it and rework it.

1265
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,120
然后我觉得 当我们设计一个非常复杂的系统
And it seems like that's the kind of problem we're really

1266
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,940
我们也要面对这样的问题
faced with we start trying to design a really complex system

1267
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:19,390
就是有太多各种各样的部件
is having lots of different kinds of parts and

1268
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:22,730
我们甚至不知道要对这些部件
not even knowing what kinds of operations we're going to want

1269
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,620
做什么样的操作
to do on those parts.

1270
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,580
在这种时候我怎么用这种科学的方法组织操作
How to organize the operations in this nice way so that no

1271
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,630
才能获得这种 不管怎样只要把它们放在一起
matter what you do, when you start putting them together

1272
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:31,700
所有事情就正常运转 这样的效果呢
everything starts falling out for free.

1273
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,090
教授：很好，这确实是一个
PROFESSOR: OK, well that's certainly a

1274
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:34,340
非常聪明的问题
very intelligent question.

1275
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,560
要说的一点是我们这种方法论
One part is this is a very good methodology that people

1276
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,590
受到了符号代数的很多启发
have discovered a lot coming from symbolic algebra.

1277
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:47,590
因为在那里面有很多复杂的理论#TBD
Because there are a lot of complications.

1278
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:50,710
允许你在决定各种操作是什么样子之前
To allow you to implement these things before you decide

1279
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:52,130
来实现这个系统
what you want all the operations to

1280
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,310
来实现这个系统
be, and all of that.

1281
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:55,580
所以从某种意义上讲 这是人们
So in some sense it's an answer that people have

1282
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,560
在这方面长期探索之后得出的答案
discovered by wading through this stuff.

1283
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,160
从另一个角度来说 这确实是一个人为设计的例子
In another sense, it is a very contrived example.

1284
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,240
学生：看上去想要设计出这样的系统
AUDIENCE: It seems like to be able to do this you do have to

1285
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,320
一开始先要研究一段时间
wade through it for a certain amount of time before you can

1286
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,010
然后才能变熟练
become good at it.

1287
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:12,220
教授：我给你看看这个东西是多么的勉强
PROFESSOR: Let me show you how terribly contrived this is.

1288
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:14,130
你现在可以写下所有的这些程序
So you can write all these wonderful things.

1289
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:17,600
但是我写在这里的这个系统 如果我们
But the system that I wrote here, and if we had another

1290
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,820
再有半个小时的上课的时间我就能
half an hour to give this lecture I would have given

1291
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:23,470
把它讲给大家 注意如果我让它做一个错误操作
this part of it, which says,notice that it breaks down if

1292
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:30,880
比如一个愚蠢的命令 用3加上7/2 它就会崩溃
I tell it to do something as foolish as add 3 plus 7/2.

1293
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,980
因为程序首先会调用operate-2这个过程
Because what will happen is you'll get to operate-2, and

1294
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:36,180
然后operate-2会说 这个是数字类型
operate-2 will say, oh this is type number,

1295
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,560
那个是有理数类型
and that's type rational.

1296
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,810
我不知道怎么把它们加起来
I don't know how to add them.

1297
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,600
那么你想让这个系统至少能够
So you'd like the system at least to be able to say

1298
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,660
比如说 在做这个操作之前
something like, gee,before you do that

1299
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,480
把3变成3/1
change that to 3/1.

1300
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,250
把它变成一个有理数 然后
Turn it into a rational number,hand that to the

1301
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,500
交给有理数程序包来处理
rational package.

1302
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:58,860
这是我讲课时没有讲到的一个东西
That's the thing I didn't talk about in this lecture.

1303
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,880
书里面讨论了这个问题
It's a little bit in the book,which talks about the problem

1304
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,390
叫做强制转换
of what's called coercion.

1305
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:05,310
你想要的是
Where you wanted--

1306
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:08,280
看 我们小心翼翼地设计了这些类型
see, having so carefully set up all of these types as

1307
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,720
来把对象进行分类 但是有时你也想让它
distinct objects, a lot of times you want to also put in

1308
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:16,650
知道怎么把一个普通的数字
knowledge about how to view an ordinary number

1309
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:19,110
当成有理数
as a kind of rational.

1310
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:21,620
或者把普通的数字当成复数
Or view an ordinary number as a kind of complex.

1311
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:24,580
到那个时候系统就开始
That's where the complexity in the system really starts

1312
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,110
变得复杂了 就是你去思考 我应该把这些知识
happening, where you talk about, see where

1313
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:28,420
放在哪里的时候
do I put that knowledge?

1314
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,810
让它知道一个普通数字可以变成组合对象
Is it rational to know that ordinary numbers might be

1315
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:33,130
真的是一件好事吗
pieces of cons of them?

1316
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:38,790
或者我们举一个更加糟糕的例子
Or they're terrible, terrible examples, like if I might want

1317
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:48,510
比如说我想要把一个复数加到有理数上去
to add a complex number to a rational number.

1318
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:50,760
这个不好
Bad example.

1319
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,010
5/7.

1320
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:57,300
然后整个系统里必须有人知道 他需要把这个东西
Then somebody's got to know that I have to convert these

1321
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,790
变成另一种类型 一个复数
to another type, which is complex numbers whose parts

1322
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,540
它的一部分是有理数
might be rationals.

1323
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:02,680
那么谁应该去操心这个事情呢
And who worries about that?

1324
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,950
是complex过程吗
Does complex worry about that?

1325
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,030
是rational过程吗
Does rational worry about that?

1326
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,900
plus过程要考虑这个问题吗
Does plus worry about that?

1327
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,520
这就是体现复杂性的地方
That's where the real complexity comes in.

1328
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,380
也是这个问题的特别之处#TBD
And that's where it's pretty well sorted out.

1329
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,810
同时很多的 实际上是所有的这样的消息传递的想法
And a lot of, in fact, all of this message passing stuff was

1330
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:18,460
都是被这样的问题启发的
motivated by problems like this.

1331
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,630
当你真正深入进去#TBD 人们
And when you really push it,people are-- somehow the

1332
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:25,330
代数操作的问题是如此复杂
algebraic manipulation problem seems to be so complex that

1333
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,410
那些一直围绕它们工作的人们 确实就处在
the people who are always at the edge of it are exactly in

1334
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:28,050
你说的那种状态
the state you said.

1335
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,940
他们在这些问题里艰难跋涉 时不时陷进泥里
They're wading through this thing, mucking around, seeing

1336
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:33,470
寻找好用的工具 并试着提炼一个通用的方法
what they use, trying to distill stuff.

1337
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:36,030
学生：我想再一次回到这个
AUDIENCE: I just want to come back to this issue of

1338
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:39,250
复杂度的问题上来
complexity once more.

1339
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:44,550
在修改底层过程的时候 这个系统
It certainly seems to be true that you have a great deal of

1340
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:49,580
毫无疑问 体现了非常大的灵活性
flexibility in altering the lower level kinds of things.

1341
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:54,320
但是确实 在某种意义上讲 你封死了
But it is true that you are,in a sense, freezing higher

1342
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,450
对高层操作的修改
level operations.

1343
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:58,510
或者至少如果你修改它们 你不知道
Or at least if you change them you don't know where all of

1344
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:02,060
改动会体现在哪里 会怎么体现出来
the changes are going to show up, or how they are.

1345
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,840
教授：这个问题真是不能再好了
PROFESSOR: OK, that's an extremely good question.

1346
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:10,130
我要做的事情就是 如果我决定添加一个
What I have to do is, if I decide there's a new general

1347
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:16,300
新的通用操作叫做equality-test 然后所有这些过程
operation called equality test,then all of these people

1348
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,835
就要查表格 来看他们需不需要
have to decide whether or not they would like to have an

1349
01:22:19,835 --> 01:22:24,650
测试两个数是否相等
equality test by looking in the table.

1350
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:27,870
我们可以让它变得更加去中心化
There're ways to decentralize it even more.

1351
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:31,430
这就是之前我提示了很多次的事情
That's what I sort of hinted at last time, where I said you

1352
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:34,240
我说你可以不仅把类型标志放在对象里
could not only have this type as a symbol, but you actually

1353
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,850
而是把每一类对象接受的操作
might store in each object the operations

1354
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:40,450
也保存在里面
that it knows of that.

1355
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:44,670
那么你可以添加一个 比如说最大公约数过程
So you might have things like greatest common divisor, which

1356
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:47,540
它只能计算整数
is a thing here which is defined only for integers, and

1357
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:51,030
而不是对所有有理数都通用
not in general for rational numbers.

1358
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:53,110
所以这个系统可能是非常非常碎片化的
So it might be a very, very fragmented system.

1359
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:56,570
取决于你想让哪一部分比较灵活
And then depending on where you want your flexibility,

1360
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:58,190
有一系列的地方让你
there's a whole spectrum of places that you

1361
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,960
把这个东西放进去
can build that in.

1362
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,320
但是你也指出了这种设计的弱点
But you're pointing at the place where this starts being

1363
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,990
就是在顶层对于这些通用操作符
weak, that there has to be some agreement on top here

1364
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,370
必须有一些约定
about these general operations.

1365
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,390
或者至少人们要考虑这件事情
Or at least people have to think about them.

1366
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:10,340
或者你可以决定 把这个表格设计得
Or you might decide, you might have a table that's very

1367
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:14,010
很稀疏 里面只放很少的一点东西
sparse, that only has a few things in it.

1368
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:15,490
这个游戏有很多种玩法
But there are lot of ways to play that game.

1369
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,030
谢谢大家
OK, thank you.
