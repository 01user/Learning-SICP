[MUSIC PLAYING BY J.S. BACH]

2
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:22,132
PROFESSOR: The last time we began having a look at how languages are constructed.

4
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:27,580
Remember the main point that an evaluator for, LISP, say, has two main elements.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:46,635
There is EVAL, and EVAL's job is to take in an expression and an environment and turn that into a procedure and some arguments and pass that off to APPLY.

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:01:07,740
And APPLY takes the procedure in the arguments, turns that back into, in a general case, another expression to be evaluated in another environment and passes that off to EVAL, which passes it to APPLY, and there's this whole big circle where things go around and around and around until you get either to some very primitive data or to a primitive procedure.

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:15,020
See, what this cycle has to do with is unwinding the means of combination and the means of abstraction in the language.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:27,670
So for instance, you have a procedure in LISP-- a procedure is a general way of saying, I want to be able to evaluate this expression for any value of the arguments, and that's sort of what's going on here.

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,510
That's what APPLY does.

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:40,440
It says the general thing coming in with the arguments reduces to the expression that's the body, and then if that's a compound expression or another procedure application, the thing will go around and around the circle.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,120
Anyway, that's sort of the basic structure of gee, pretty much any interpreter.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,870
The other thing that you saw is once you have the interpreter in your hands, you have all this power to start playing with the language.

33
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:57,680
So you can make it dynamically scoped, or you can put in normal order evaluation, or you can add new forms to the language, whatever you like.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:18,010
Or more generally, there's this notion of metalinguistic abstraction, which says that part of your perspective as an engineer, as a software engineer, but as an engineer in general is that you can gain control of complexity by inventing new languages sometimes.

41
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:26,440
See, one way to think about computer programming is that it only incidentally has to do with getting a computer to do something.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,270
Primarily what a computer program has to do with, it's a way of expressing ideas with communicating ideas.

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,770
And sometimes when you want to communicate new kinds of ideas, you'd like to invent new modes of expressing that.

48
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,730
Well, today we're going to apply this framework to build a new language.

50
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,830
See, once we have the basic idea of the interpreter, you can pretty much go build any language that you like.

52
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,370
So for example, we can go off and build Pascal.

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:15,350
And gee, we would worry about syntax and parsing and various kinds of compiler optimizations, and there are people who make honest livings doing that, but at the level of abstraction that we're talking, a Pascal interpreter would not look very different at all from what you saw Gerry do last time.

59
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:29,090
Instead of that, we'll spend today building a really different language, a language that encourages you to think about programming not in terms of procedures, but in a really different way.

63
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,810
And the lecture today is going to be at two levels simultaneously.

65
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,010
On the one hand, I'm going to show you what this language looks like, and on the other hand, I'll show you how it's implemented.

68
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,220
And we'll build an implementation in LISP and see how that works.

70
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,730
And you should be drawing lessons on two levels.

71
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,790
The first is to realize just how different a language can be.

73
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:01,560
So if you think that the jump from Fortran to LISP is a big deal, you haven't seen anything yet.

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:20,950
And secondly, you'll see that even with such a very different language, which will turn out to not have procedures at all and not talk about functions at all, there will still be this basic cycle of eval and apply that's unwinds the means of combination and the means an abstraction.

81
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:28,970
And then thirdly, as kind of a minor but elegant technical point, you'll see a nice use of streams to avoid backtracking.

85
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,860
OK, well, I said that this language is very different.

86
00:04:35,860 --> 00:05:05,970
To explain that, let's go back to the very first idea that we talked about in this course, and that was the idea of the distinction between the declarative knowledge of mathematics-- the definition of a square root as a mathematical truth-- and the idea that computer science talks about the how to knowledge-- contrast that definition of square root with a program to compute a square root.

95
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,042
That's where we started off.

96
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:22,380
Well, wouldn't it be great if you could somehow bridge this gap and make a programming language which sort of did things, but you talked about it in terms of truth, in declarative terms?

100
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,690
So that would be a programming language in which you specify facts.

102
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,880
You tell it what is.

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,950
You say what is true.

104
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:46,200
And then when you want an answer, somehow the language has built into it automatically general kinds of how to knowledge so it can just take your facts and it can evolve these methods on its on using the facts you gave it and maybe some general rules of logic.

110
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:55,645
So for instance, I might go up to this program and start telling it some things.

112
00:05:55,645 --> 00:06:08,920
So I might tell it that the son of Adam is Abel.

113
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:17,660
And I might tell it that the son of Adam is Cain.

114
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:24,670
And I might tell it that the son of Cain is Enoch.

116
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:48,760
And I might tell it that the son of Enoch is Irad, and all through the rest of our chapter whatever of Genesis, which ends up ending in Adah, by the way, and this shows the genealogy of Adah from Cain.

120
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,510
Anyway, once you tell it these facts, you might ask it things.

122
00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:00,420
You might go up to your language and say, who's the son of Adam?

124
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:14,140
And you can very easily imagine having a little general purpose search program which would be able to go through and in response to that say, oh yeah, there are two answers: the son of Adam is Abel and the son of Adam is Cain.

129
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:21,950
Or you might say, based on the very same facts, who is Cain the son of?

131
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:35,890
And then you can imagine generating another slightly different search program which would be able to go through and checked for who is Cain, and son of, and come up with Adam.

135
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:42,070
Or you might say, what's the relationship between Cain and Enoch?

137
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,340
And again, a minor variant on that search program.

138
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,160
You could figure out that it said son of.

140
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:06,520
But even here in this very simple example, what you see is that a single fact, see, a single fact like the son of Adam is Cain can be used to answer different kinds of questions.

144
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,970
You can say, who's the son of, or you can say who's the son of Adam, or you can say what's the relation between Adam and Cain?

147
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:22,474
Those are different questions being run by different traditional procedures all based on the same fact.

149
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:41,490
And that's going to be the essence of the power of this programming style, that one piece of declarative knowledge can be used as the basis for a lot of different kinds of how-to knowledge, as opposed to the kinds of procedures we're writing where you sort of tell it what input you're giving it and what answer you want.

155
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:48,900
So for instance, our square root program can perfectly well answer the question, what's the square root of 144?

157
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,830
But in principle, the mathematical definition of square root tells you other things.

159
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,590
Like it could say, what is 17 the square root of?

160
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,920
And that would be have to be answered by a different program.

162
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:10,900
So the mathematical definition, or in general, the facts that you give it are somehow unbiased as to what the question is.

165
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,700
Whereas the programs we tend to write specifically because they are how-to knowledge tend to be looking for a specific answer.

168
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,810
So that's going to be one characteristic of what we're talking about.

170
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,480
We can go on.

171
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,710
We can imagine that we've given our language some sort of facts.

173
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,020
Now let's give it some rules of inference.

174
00:09:30,020 --> 00:10:09,320
We can say, for instance, if the-- make up some syntax here-- if the son of x is y-- I'll put question marks to indicate variables here-- if the son of x is y and the son of y is z, then the grandson of x is z.

180
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:20,610
So I can imagine telling my machine that rule and then being able to say, for instance, who's the grandson of Adam?

183
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,790
Or who is Irad the grandson of?

184
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,330
Or deduce all grandson relationships you possibly can from this information.

187
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,830
We can imagine somehow the language knowing how to do that automatically.

190
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
Let me give you maybe a little bit more concrete example.

192
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,700
Here's a procedure that merges two sorted lists.

193
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:04,780
So x and y are two, say, lists of numbers, lists of distinct numbers, if you like, that are in increasing order.

195
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:16,390
And what merge does is take two such lists and combine them into a list where everything's in increasing order, and this is a pretty easy programs that you ought to be able to write.

199
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,860
It says, if x is empty, the answer is y.

200
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,180
If y is empty, the answer is x.

201
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,990
Otherwise, you compare the first two elements.

202
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:42,400
So you pick out the first thing in x and the first thing in y, and then depending on which of those first elements is less, you stick the lower one on to the result a recursively merging, either chopping the first one off x or chopping the first one off y.

207
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,960
That's a standard kind of program.

209
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,620
Let's look at the logic.

210
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,820
Let's forget about the program and look at the logic on which that procedure is based.

212
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:08,430
See, there's some logic which says, gee, if the first one is less, then we get the answer by sticking something onto the result of recursively merging the rest. So let's try and be explicit about what that logic is that's making the program work.

217
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,130
So here's one piece.

218
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:19,980
Here's the piece of the program which recursively chops down x if the first thing in x is smaller.

220
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:55,820
And if you want to be very explicit about what the logic is there, what's really going on is a deduction, which says, if you know that some list, that we'll call cdr of x, and y merged to form z, and you know that a is less than the first thing in y, then you know that if you put a onto the cdr of x, then that result and y merge to form a onto z.

226
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:09,410
And what that is, that's the underlying piece of logic-- I haven't written it as a program, I wrote it a sort of deduction that's underneath this particular clause that says we can use the recursion there.

230
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,000
And then similar, here's the other clause just to complete it.

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:30,740
The other clause is based on this piece of logic, which is almost the same and I won't go through it, and then there's the n cases where we tested for null, and that's based on the idea that for any x, x and the empty list merge to form an x, or for any y, the empty list and y merge to form y.

238
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:41,740
OK, so there's a piece of procedure and the logic on which it's based.

240
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,750
And notice a big difference.

241
00:13:44,750 --> 00:14:07,550
The procedure looked like this: it said there was a box-- and all the things we've been doing have the characteristic we have boxes and things going in and things going out-- there was this box called merge, and in came an x and y, and out came an answer.

247
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,340
That's the character of the procedure that we wrote.

249
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,660
These rules don't look like that.

250
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,620
These rules talk about a relation.

251
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:25,370
There's some sort of relation that in those slides I called mrege-to-form.

253
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,610
So I said x and y merge to form z, and somehow this is a function.

255
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:32,850
Right?

256
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:39,720
The answer is a function of x and y, and here what I have is a relation between three things.

258
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,200
And I'm not going to specify which is the input and which is the output.

260
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:54,570
And the reason I want to say that is because in principle, we could use exactly those same logic rules to answer a lot of different questions.

263
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,050
So we can say, for instance-- imagine giving our machine those rules of logic.

265
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,400
Not the program, the underlying rules of logic.

266
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:20,910
Then it ought to be able to say-- we could ask it-- 1, 3, 7 and 2, 4, 8 merge to form what?

269
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,880
And that's a question it ought to be able to answer.

270
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,180
That's exactly the same question that our list procedure answered.

272
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:45,560
But the exact same rules should also be able to answer a question like this: 1, 3, 7 and what merged to form 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8?

275
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,880
The same rules of logic can answer this, although the procedure we wrote can't answer that question.

277
00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:13,780
Or we might be able to say what and what else merge to form-- what and what else merge to form 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8?

280
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:22,540
And the thing should be able to go through, if it really can apply that logic, and deduce all, whatever is, 2 to the sixth answers to that question.

284
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,790
It could be 1 and the rest, or it could be 1, 2 and the rest.

285
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,410
Or it could be 1 and 3 and 7 and the rest. There's a whole bunch of answers.

287
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,550
And in principle, the logic should be enough to deduce that.

289
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:54,150
So there are going to be two big differences in the kind of program we're going to look at and not only list, but essentially all the programming you've probably done so far in pretty much any language you can think of.

293
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,620
The first is, we're not going to be computing functions.

295
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,410
We're not going to be talking about things that take input and output.

297
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,890
We're going to be talking about relations.

298
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,089
And that means in principle, these relations don't have directionality.

300
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:21,345
So the knowledge that you specify to answer this question, that same knowledge should also allow you to answer these other questions and conversely.

304
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:35,610
And the second issue is that since we're talking about relations, these relations don't necessarily have one answer.

307
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,415
So that third question down there doesn't have a particular answer, it has a whole bunch of answers.

310
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,640
Well, that's where we're going.

311
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,310
This style of programming, by the way, is called logic programming, for kind of obvious reasons.

314
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:19,200
And people who do logic programming say that-- they have this little phrase-- they say the point of logic programming is that you use logic to express what is true, you use logic to check whether something is true, and you use logic to find out what is true.

319
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,780
The best known logic programming language, as you probably know, is called Prolog.

321
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:35,320
The language that we're going to implement this morning is something we call the query language, and it essentially has the essence of prologue.

324
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:44,210
It can do about the same stuff, although it's a lot slower because we're going to implement it in LISP rather than building a particular compiler.

327
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,510
We're going to interpret it on top of the LISP interpreter.

328
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,750
But other than that, it can do about the same stuff as prolog.

330
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,696
It has about the same power and about the same limitations.

332
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,120
All right, let's break for question.

334
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,720
STUDENT: Yes, could you please repeat what the three things you use logic programming to find?

336
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,840
In other words, to find what is true, learn what is true-- what is the?

338
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,520
PROFESSOR: Right.

339
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,850
Sort of a logic programmer's little catechism.

340
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:22,610
You use logic to express what is true, like these rules.

341
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:28,550
You use logic to check whether something is true, and that's the kind of question I didn't answer here.

343
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:45,690
I might say-- another question I could put down here is to say, is it true that 1, 3, 7 and 2, 4, 8 merge to form 1, 2, 6, 10 And that same logic should be enough to say no.

347
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,480
So I use logic to check what is true, and then you also use logic to find out what's true.

350
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,570
All right.

351
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,138
Let's break.

00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:22,106
[MUSIC PLAYING BY J.S. BACH]

353

[MUSIC ENDS]

354
00:20:47,590 --> 00:21:02,901
[MUSIC PLAYING BY J.S. BACH]

355
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:10,520
PROFESSOR: OK, let's go ahead and take a look at this query language and operation.

357
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:21,330
The first thing you might notice, when I put up that little biblical database, is that it's nice to be able to ask this language questions in relation to some collection of facts.

361
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,060
So let's start off and make a little collection of facts.

362
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:37,500
This is a tiny fragment of personnel records for a Boston high tech company, and here's a piece of the personnel records of Ben Bitdiddle.

365
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:46,420
And Ben Bitdiddle is the computer wizard in this company, he's the underpaid computer wizard in this company.

368
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,150
His supervisor is all Oliver Warbucks, and here's his address.

370
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,300
So the format is we're giving this information: job, salary, supervisor, address.

372
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,250
And there are some other conventions.

373
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:06,440
Computer here means that Ben works in the computer division, and his position in the computer division is wizard.

376
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,580
Here's somebody else.

377
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:17,550
Alyssa, Alyssa P. Hacker is a computer programmer, and she works for Ben, and she lives in Cambridge.

379
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,820
And there's another programmer who works for Ben who's Lem E. Tweakit.

381
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:30,100
And there's a programmer trainee, who is Louis Reasoner, and he works for Alyssa.

383
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:37,010
And the big wheel of the company doesn't work for anybody, right?

385
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,110
That's Oliver Warbucks.

386
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:44,971
Anyway, what we're going to do is ask questions about that little world.

388
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:48,660
And that'll be a sample world that we're going to do logic in.

391
00:22:51,420 --> 00:23:28,500
Let me just write up here, for probably the last time, what I said is the very most important thing you should get out of this course, and that is, when somebody tells you about a language, you say, fine-- what are the primitives, what are the means of combination, how do you put the primitives together, and then how do you abstract them, how do you abstract the compound pieces so you can use them as pieces to make something more complicated?

400
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,690
And we've said this a whole bunch of times already, but it's worth saying again.

403
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:36,670
Let's start.

404
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,040
The primitives.

405
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,400
Well, there's really only one primitive, and the primitive in this language is called a query.

407
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,810
A primitive query.

408
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,060
Let's look at some primitive queries.

410
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,100
Job x.

411
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,550
Who is a computer programmer?

412
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:06,640
Or find every fact in the database that matches job of the x is computer programmer.

414
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,470
And you see a little syntax here.

415
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:21,930
Things without question marks are meant to be literal, question mark x means that's a variable, and this thing will match, for example, the fact that Alyssa P. Hacker is a computer programmer, or x is Alyssa P. Hacker.

420
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,750
Or more generally, I could have something with two variables in it.

422
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:42,140
I could say, the job of x is computer something, and that'll match computer wizard.

424
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:50,370
So there's something here: type will match wizard, or type will match programmer, or x might match various certain things.

427
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,150
So there are, in our little example, only three facts in that database that match that query.

430
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:24,810
Let's see, just to show you some syntax, the same query, this query doesn't match the job of x, doesn't match Lewis Reasoner, the reason for that is when I write something here, what I mean is that this is going to be a list of two symbols, of which the first is the word computer, and the second can be anything.

436
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:30,340
And Lewis's job description here has three symbols, so it doesn't match.

438
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:50,600
And just to show you a little bit of syntax, the more general thing I might want to type is a thing with a dot here, and this is just standard this notation for saying, this is a list, of which the first element is the word computers, and THE REST, is something that I'll call type.

445
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,930
So this one would match.

446
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:06,960
Lewis's job is computer programmer trainee, and type here would be the cdr of this list. It would be the list programmer trainee.

449
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,460
And that kind of dot processing is done automatically by the LISP reader.

452
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,760
Well, let's actually try this.

453
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,630
The idea is I'm going to type in queries in this language, and answers will come out.

455
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,180
Let's look at this.

456
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,000
I can go up and say, who works in the computer division?

457
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,730
Job of x is computer dot y.

458
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,562
Doesn't matter what I call the dummy variables.

459
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:45,690
It says the answers to that, and it's found four answers.

461
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,505
Or I can go off and say, tell me about everybody's supervisor.

463
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:59,390
So I'll put in the query, the primitive query, the supervisor of x is y.

466
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,540
There are all the supervisor relationships I know.

467
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,830
Or I could go type in, who lives in Cambridge?

468
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:20,670
So I can say, the address of x is Cambridge dot anything.

470
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,585
And only one person lives in Cambridge.

472
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,170
OK, so those are primitive queries.

473
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:39,620
And you see what happens to basic interaction with the system is you type in a query, and it types out all possible answers.

476
00:27:39,620 --> 00:28:01,000
Or another way to say that: it finds out all the possible values of those variables x and y or t or whatever I've called them, and it types out all ways of taking that query and instantiating it-- remember that from the rule system lecture-- instantiates the query with all possible values for those variables and then types out all of them.

483
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,350
And there are a lot of ways you can arrange a logic language.

485
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,010
Prolog, for instance, does something slightly different.

486
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:12,650
Rather than typing back your query, prolog would type out, x equals this and y equals that, or x sequels this and y equals that.

489
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:19,070
And that's a very surface level thing, you can decide what you like.

491
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,760
OK.

492
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,340
All right.

493
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,390
So the primitives in this language?

494
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,570
Only one, right?

495
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,230
Primitive query.

497
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,650
OK.

498
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,330
Means of combination.

499
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:39,770
Let's look at some compound queries in this language.

500
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,790
Here's one.

501
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:49,810
This one says, tell me all the people who work in the computer division.

503
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,860
Tell me all the people who work in the computer division together with their supervisors.

506
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,220
The way I write that is the query is and.

507
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,920
And the job of the x is computer something or other.

508
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,560
And job of x is computer dot y.

509
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,650
And the supervisor of x is z.

510
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,460
Tell me all the people in the computer division-- that's this-- together with their supervisors.

512
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:23,660
And notice in this query I have three variables-- x, y, and z.

514
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,450
And this x is supposed to be the same as that x.

515
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:34,810
So x works in the computer division, and the supervisor of x is z.

517
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,250
Let's try another one.

518
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,005
So one means of combination is and.

520
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,790
Who are all the people who make more than $30,000?

521
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:51,640
And the salary of some person p is some amount a.

523
00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:00,600
And when I go and look at a, a is greater than $30,000.

524
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:10,600
And LISP value here is a little piece of interface that interfaces the query language to the underlying LISP.

526
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,180
And what the LISP value allows you to do is call any LISP predicate inside a query.

528
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,020
So here I'm using the LISP predicate greater than, so I say LISP value.

530
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,750
This I say and.

531
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:28,190
So all the people whose salary is greater than $30,000.

532
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,270
Or here's a more complicated one.

533
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:39,810
Tell me all the people who work in the computer division who do not have a supervisor who works in the computer division.

537
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,510
and x works in the computer division.

538
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,780
The job of x is computer dot y.

539
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:59,620
And it's not the case that both x has a supervisor z and the job of z is computer something or other.

541
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:05,710
All right, so again, this x has got to be that x, and this z is going to be that z.

544
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,380
And then you see another means a combination, not.

546
00:31:17,272 --> 00:31:20,880
All right, well, let's look at that.

547
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,400
It works the same way.

548
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:35,400
I can go up to the machine and say and the job of the x is computer dot y.

551
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:46,600
And the supervisor of x is z.

552
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,794
And I typed that in like a query.

553
00:31:50,794 --> 00:31:58,930
And what it types back, what you see are the queries I typed in instantiated by all possible answers.

555
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,000
And then you see there are a lot of answers.

556
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,190
All right.

557
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:09,800
So the means of combination in this language-- and this is why it's called a logic language-- are logical operations.

560
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:18,490
Means of combinations are things like AND and NOT and there's one I didn't show you, which is OR.

562
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:29,250
And then I showed you LISP value, which is not logic, of course, but is a little special hack to interface that to LISP so you can get more power.

565
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,690
Those are the means of combination.

566
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,160
OK, the means of abstraction.

567
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:42,260
What we'd like to do--  let's go back for second and look at that last slide.

570
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:52,400
We might like to take very complicated thing, the idea that someone works in a division but does not have a supervisor in the division.

573
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,090
And as before, name that.

574
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:02,750
Well, if someone works in a division and does not have a supervisor who works in that division, that means that person is a big shot.

577
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:21,510
So let's make a rule that somebody x is a big shot in some department if x works in the department and it's not the case that x has a supervisor who works in the department.

581
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,940
So this is our means of abstraction.

582
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,190
This is a rule.

584
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,580
And a rule has three parts.

586
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,450
The thing that says it's a rule.

587
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,530
And then there's the conclusion of the rule.

588
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,000
And then there's the body of the rule.

589
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:49,470
And you can read this as a piece of logic which says, if you know that the body of the rule is true, then you can conclude that the conclusion is true.

592
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:57,480
Or in order to deduce that x is a big shot in some department, it's enough to verify that.

594
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,820
So that's what rules look like.

596
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,110
Let's go back and look at that merge example that I did before the break.

598
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,610
Let's look at how that would look in terms of rules.

599
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,500
I'm going to take the logic I put up and just change it into a bunch of rules in this format.

602
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,350
We have a rule.

603
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,710
Remember, there was this thing merge-to-form.

604
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:29,620
There is a rule that says, the empty list and y merge to form y.

606
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,870
This is the rule conclusion.

608
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,650
And notice this particular rule has no body.

609
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,239
And in this language, a rule with no body is something that is always true.

611
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,510
You can always assume that's true.

613
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,460
And there was another piece of logic that said anything in the empty list merged to form the anything.

615
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,900
That's this.

616
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,510
A rule y and the empty list merge to form y.

617
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:03,490
Those corresponded to the two end cases in our merge procedure, but now we're talking about logic, not about procedures.

620
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:09,830
Then we had another rule, which said if you know how shorter things merge, you can put them together.

622
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:48,690
So this says, if you have a list x and y and z, and if you want to deduce that a dot x-- this means constant a onto x, or a list whose first thing is a and whose rest is x-- so if you want to deduce that a dot x and b dot y merge to form b dot c--  that would say you merge these two lists a x and b y and you're going to get something that starts with b-- you can deduce that if you know that it's the case both that a dot x and y merge to form z and a is larger than b.

632
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:57,960
So when I merge them, b will come first in the list. That's a little translation of the logic rule that I wrote in pseudo-English before.

635
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,130
And then just for completeness, here's the other case.

637
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:12,190
a dot x and b dot y merge to form a dot z if x and b dot y merged to form z and b is larger than a.

639
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:17,416
So that's a little program that I've typed in in this language, and now let's look at it run.

642
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:28,510
So I typed in the merge rules before, and I could use this like a procedure.

644
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:39,590
I could say merge to form 1 and 3 and 2 and 7.

645
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,330
So here I'm using it like the LISP procedure.

646
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,190
Now it's going to think about that for a while and apply these rules.

649
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,800
So it found an answer.

650
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,810
Now it's going to see if there are any other answers but it doesn't know a priori there's only one answer.

652
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,970
So it's sitting here checking all possibilities, and it says, no more.

654
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,775
Done.

655
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,210
So there I've used those rules like a procedure.

656
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:10,220
Or remember the whole point is that I can ask different kinds of questions.

658
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:24,590
I could say merge to form, let's see, how about 2 and a.

659
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:39,510
Some list of two elements which I know starts with 2, and the other thing I don't know, and x and some other list merge to form a 1, 2, 3 and 4.

663
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,590
So now it's going to think about that.

664
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,095
It's got to find--  so it found one possibility.

667
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:53,830
It said a could be 3, and x could be the list 1, 4.

668
00:37:53,830 --> 00:38:00,300
And now, again, it's got to check because it doesn't a priori know that there aren't any other possibilities going on.

672
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:17,275
Or like I said, I could say something like merge to form, like, what and what else merge to form 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

675
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,590
Now it's going to think about that.

677
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,310
And there are a lot of answers that it might get.

679
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,170
And what you see is here you're really paying the price of slowness.

682
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,880
And kind of for three reasons.

683
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,630
One is that this language is doubly interpreted.

684
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:52,190
Whereas in a real implementation, you would go compile this down to primitive operations.

686
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:58,380
The other reason is that this particular algorithm for merges is doubly recursive.

688
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,020
So it's going to take a very long time.

689
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,130
And eventually, this is going to go through and find-- find what?

691
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,730
Two to the fifth possible answers.

693
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:20,160
And you see they come out in some fairly arbitrary order, depending on which order it's going to be trying these rules.

696
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,310
In fact, what we're going to do when they edit the videotape is speed all this up.

698
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,600
Don't you like taking out these weights?

699
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,250
And don't you wish you could do that in your demos?

701
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,260
Anyway, it's still grinding there.

703
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,630
Anyway, there are 32 possibilities-- we won't wait for it to print out all of them.

706
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,660
OK, so the needs of abstraction in this language are rules.

709
00:39:53,630 --> 00:40:00,350
So we take some bunch of things that are put together with logic and we name them.

711
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,410
And you can think of that as naming a particular pattern of logic.

713
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:10,660
Or you can think of that as saying, if you want to deduce some conclusion, you can apply those rules of logic.

715
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,420
And those are three elements of this language.

716
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,920
Let's break now, and then we'll talk about how it's actually implemented.

719
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:31,770
STUDENT: Does using LISP value primitive or whatever interfere with your means to go both directions on a query?

721
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:40,090
PROFESSOR: OK, that's a-- the question is, does using LISP value interfere with the ability to go both directions on the query?

724
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:46,890
We haven't really talked about the implementation yet, but the answer is, yes, it can.

726
00:40:46,890 --> 00:41:08,700
In general, as we'll see at the end-- although I really won't to go into details-- it's fairly complicated, especially when you use either not or LISP value-- or actually, if you use anything besides only and, it becomes very complicated to say when these things will work.

733
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,360
They won't work quite in all situations.

734
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,300
I'll talk about that at the end of the second half today.

735
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:24,170
But the answer to your question is, yes, by dragging in a lot more power from LISP value, you lose some of the principal power of logic programming.

738
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,090
That's a trade-off that you have to make.

739
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,390
OK, let's take a break.
